We've had  three meetings which brought out very different issues from different  traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to  be outside the scope of position consolidation.  Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to  make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this  project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this  project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and  work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all  drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan.  Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal  ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that  add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical,  transport, swaps, options, ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index, Physical gas for Nymex, Physical gas for Inside Ferc, Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility  skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a  gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position  manager. Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms,  prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change. Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker. Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of  individual deals on the position total in a grid cell. Benchmark positions in TDS. Deployment of TDS in Canada.

Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on San Marcos that you received earlier. If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?  San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.  Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now.  If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will know more on this question later today.  Sincerely,  George W.

It appears that a single  buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above  market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades,  offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were  bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index  calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated  financial swaps for San Juan.   We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:   1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.    2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily.

Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.

Crocker\"  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.  INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.  PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested.  I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding  as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like  anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate  closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.?  ? If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is  no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.?  ? I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and  find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can. ? I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable  document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.?  This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last  night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said  this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.?  ? I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at  that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even  needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any  need to contact me regarding the  closing. ? I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself  and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't  seem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my  signature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it  reviewed before I accept it. ?

Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to  use? Names?

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W.

Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W.

We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.

The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the  distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for  power quality reasons.  The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due  to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm  trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months  due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand,  Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude  awakening in the next 2-3 years. ---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000  03:41 PM ---------------------------     \tEnron North America Corp. \t \tFrom:  John D Suarez                           09/05/2000 01:45 PM \t  To: Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Dana Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul J  Broderick/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey Miller/NA/Enron@Enron cc:   Subject:    ---------------------- Forwarded by John D Suarez/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000 01:46  PM ---------------------------   George Hopley 09/05/2000 11:41 AM To: John D Suarez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Suresh Vasan/Enron Communications@ENRON  COMMUNICATIONS@ENRON cc:   Subject:   Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on                   Local Utilities                     ( September 05, 2000 )                      In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus                   Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in  Tukwila.                          The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and  computer servers for the                   region's growing number of dot-coms.                          Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up  construction                   on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than  a mile from its                   original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several  fiber optic backbones, the                   Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and  eventually                   house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,  Microsoft and Onvia.com.                          Exodus is not the only company building massive data  centers near Seattle.                   More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,  Globix and                   HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house  the networking                   equipment of the Internet economy.                          It is a big business that could have an effect on  everything from your                   monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access  your favorite Web sites.                         Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and  server farms, are                   sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent  Valley that some                   have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and  Puget Sound                   Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,  high-security                   facilities.                          \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that  are requesting 445                   megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\"  said Karl                   Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound  Energy. \"That is                   the equivalent of six oil refineries.\"                          A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,  the rise of the Internet                   data center has some utility veterans scratching their  heads.                          Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington  Utilities and                   Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new  data centers. The                   tariff is designed to protect the company's existing  residential and business                   customers from footing the bill for the new base stations  necessary to support                   the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20  million each,                   Karzmar said.                          Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to  bring up the data center                   issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                          For the utilities that provide power to homes,  businesses and schools in the                   region, this is a new and complex issue.                          On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing  appetite for power --                   represent potentially lucrative business customers. The  facilities run 24 hours a                   day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a  constant revenue                   stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that  they could                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital  expenditures.                          Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will  mean for power rates                   in the area is still open to debate.                          \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense  loads,\" said Bob Royer,                   director of communications and public affairs at Seattle  City Light.                          \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium  lights at the football                   game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.  We have data                   center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40  and 50 megawatts.\"                          With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate  complex in Tukwila is                   one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased  the 1.35 million                   square-foot Intergate East facility last September from  Boeing Space &                   Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased  92 percent of the                   six-building complex to seven different co-location  companies.                          \"It is probably the largest data center park in the  country,\" boasts Laurent                   Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG  Communications,                   NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama  Networks all                   lease space in the office park.                          After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,  Sabey has become an                   expert in the arena and now has facilities either under  management or                   development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole  claims his firm is                   one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in  the country.                          As more people access the Internet and conduct  bandwidth-heavy tasks                   such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for  co-location space in                   Seattle continues to escalate.                          But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center  space is growing at a                   rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,  causing similar                   concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and  California.                          Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location  space, plans to nearly                   double the amount of space it has by the end of the year.  While companies                   such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many  high-tech companies                   have decided to outsource the operations to companies such  as Exodus that                   may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic  management.                          \"We have 2 million square feet of space under  construction and we plan to                   double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more  demand right now                   than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account  executive at Exodus in                   Seattle.                          The booming market for co-location space has left some  in the local utility                   industry perplexed.                          \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do  to serve the growth,\"                   said Seattle City Light's Royer. \"The utility industry is  almost stunned by this, in                   a way.\"", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/06/2000 10:49 AM --------------------------- Jeff Richter 09/06/2000 07:39 AM To: Phillip K Al", "id": "enron_63"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["ina.rangel@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-09-06 03:46:00", "subject": "Re:", "body": "Ina,   Can you pull Tori K.'s and Martin Cuilla's resumes and past performance  reviews from H.R.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/06/2000  10:44 AM ---------------------------   John J Lavorato@ENRON 09/06/2000 05:39 AM To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re:    The commercial support people that you and Hunter want to make commercial  managers.", "preview": "Ina, Can you pull Tori K.'s and Martin Cuilla's resumes and past performance reviews from H.R. ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09", "id": "enron_64"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["john.lavorato@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-09-05 23:22:00", "subject": "Re:", "body": "resumes of whom?", "preview": "resumes of whom?", "id": "enron_65"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["ina.rangel@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-09-05 06:51:00", "subject": "RE: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence Program", "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000  01:50 PM ---------------------------   \"Christi Smith\" <christi.smith@lrinet.com> on 09/05/2000 11:40:59 AM Please respond to <christi.smith@lrinet.com> To: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com> cc: \"Debbie Nowak (E-mail)\" <dnowak@enron.com>  Subject: RE: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence  Program   We have not received your completed Team Selection information.

Now that we have had several traders  managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss  any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu  (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they  will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this  meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is  comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those  who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have  heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to  discuss them.

If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS  information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed  as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days  ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to  call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.  With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees  between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to  have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee  data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the  year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC  requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their  profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education  need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is  accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to  hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com  on the command line of your browser.  The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would  like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned  for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please  contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.    Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.      Thanks,   Dave", "preview": "What is GIS info?

The  WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,  which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes  the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but  there can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\"  generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule their  generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you  will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california  munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,  if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply  schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said  all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on  the generation side.  On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While  they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is  better than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the  load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.  I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with  others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas  demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,  especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the  UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal  consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be  an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is  O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to  get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and  I'll take care of it..  On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate  curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of  $235,019.    (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your  overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects  something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal  #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.   139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)   139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)   139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)   231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)   153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)  Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to  GDP-Kingsgate.   Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five  different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for  withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a  Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is  that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport  losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.   I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a  systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems  that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,  the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the  detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it  appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be  an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar  impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in  case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the  volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.

As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other  candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy  to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our  opportunities.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to  discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to  gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.   Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are  typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?   How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main  contacts at SW Gas?  We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our  control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably  have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the  commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their  commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)  should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month  index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That  risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of  their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.  As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are  there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly  appreciated.  Thanks,  Laird", "preview": "Laird, Did you meet with SWG on April 27th.

PIRA focuses on the  California/Southwest Region in its study of Natural Gas  Pipeline  Infrastructure  PIRA  Energy Group announces the continuation of its new multi-client study,  The  Price of Reliability: The Value and Strategy of Gas  Transportation.  The Price of Reliability, delivered in 6  parts (with each part representing  a discrete North American region), offers  insights into the changes and  developments in the North American natural gas  pipeline infrastructure. The  updated prospectus, which is attached in PDF and  Word files, outlines PIRA's  approach and methodology, study deliverables  and?release dates.  This note  is to inform you that PIRA has commenced its study of the third  region:  California & the Southwest. As in all regions, this  study begins  with a fundamental view of gas flows in the U.S. and Canada.  Pipelines in  this region (covering CA, NV, AZ, NM) will be discussed in greater  detail  within the North American context. Then we turn to the value of   transportation at the following three major pricing points with an assessment  of  the primary market (firm), secondary market (basis) and asset market:  ??????1) Southern  California border (Topock) ??????2) San Juan  Basin ??????3) Permian  Basin (Waha)?  The California/SW region\u0001,s  workshop \u0001* a key element of the service \u0001* will  take place on March 20, 2000,at 8:30 AM, at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in   Phoenix.?For those of you joining  us, a?discounted  block  of rooms is being  held through February 25.  The attached prospectus explains the various  options for subscribing.?Please  note  two key issues in regards to your subscribing options:?One, there is a  10% savings for  PIRA retainer clients who order before February 25, 2000;  and?two, there are discounts for  purchasing?more than one  region.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is  reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into  the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.   Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of  contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).    According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.   Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.   Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis.   SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.    The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/07/2001 06:54 AM --------------------------- From: Kristin Walsh/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/04/200", "id": "enron_284"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["mike.grigsby@enron.com", "keith.holst@enron.com", "frank.ermis@enron.com", "jane.tholt@enron.com", "jay.reitmeyer@enron.com", "tori.kuykendall@enron.com", "matthew.lenhart@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2001-05-04 05:18:00", "subject": "Re: Western Wholesale Activities - Gas & Power Conf.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that  the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large  part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which  the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman  began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or  answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had  some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce  demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would  export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty  strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner  out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and  if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the  agenda.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.  March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand  over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for  temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates  into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as  compared with the previous year.  Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary  reductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other  forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making  total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.   This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple  more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%  decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the  retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it  is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last  year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in  Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation  are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of  meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general  economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least  make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.  Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area  only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC  (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO  portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in  demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As  you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum  smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at  least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its  wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several  mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are  sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly  how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.   Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's  economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of  the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I  think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already  realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the  non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the  WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around  6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.  I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you  with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I  hope this helps.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new  building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being  offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.  This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the  new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The  cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is  currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly  employee cost of $94.00.  If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to  the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made  as spaces become available.   The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be  opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street  level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available.  Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an  exit in the event of elevator trouble.   If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to  Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your  email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and  receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new  garage.  The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and  Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.   (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians,  will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/02/2001 02:49 PM --------------------------- Parking & Transportation@ENRON 03/28/2001 02:07 P", "id": "enron_344"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["pallen70@hotmail.com"], "sent_at": "2001-04-02 05:52:00", "subject": "(no subject)", "body": "https://www4.rsweb.com/61045/", "preview": "https://www4.rsweb.com/61045/", "id": "enron_345"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["jacquestc@aol.com"], "sent_at": "2001-03-29 04:01:00", "subject": "Re:", "body": "Jacques  I am out of the office for the rest of the week.

I was going for a simple farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.  A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:  There will be a double porch across the back just like the front No dormers (Metal roof) 1/2 bath under stairs Overall dimensions are 55 by 40   What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry. Reagan suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about bringing the left side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front. That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front porch would be smaller.  I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.

What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory  joist?  3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?  4.

Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?  6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know  the difference between an apron and a stool.  7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent  cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?  8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial  one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.  9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under  the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.  10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount  stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.  11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.  12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?  13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?  14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron  railings?  15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except  for change orders?

According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.  Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however.  More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/15/2001 02:22 PM --------------------------- \"Arthur O'Donnell\" <aod@newsdata.com> on 03/15/20", "id": "enron_380"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["kim.bolton@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2001-03-15 06:11:00", "subject": "RE: PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL COMPENSATION INFORMATION", "body": "Thanks for the information.

Phillip Allen  Keith Holst  ENRON  1400 Smith Street  Houston, TX? 77002-7361  Subject: Bishops Corner, Ltd. -- Restructure or Buyout  Dear Phillip and Keith:   We are prepared to sell Bishops Corner, Ltd. for reimbursement of our cash  expenditures; compensation for our management services and your assumption of  all note obligations and design contracts.?   As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and  existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company,  and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which  current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.  Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this  project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design  and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of  our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or  rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.?   Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a  percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on  your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%,  or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the  second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per  year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these  valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the  forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in  the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future  projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per  month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the  attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings  the total net buyout to $78,946.?   We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we  offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout  offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are  prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.?  If this is your     choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney,  Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then  draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the  Bishops Corner, Ltd.

He has also completed a  topographical survey and a tree survey.  In addition, he has begun to  coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the  smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading.  Hugo is going  to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to  complete.  The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which  $14,000 are due now for work completed.    We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by  the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land.  If we can  continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention.  Hugo's  number is 512-295-8052.  I thought you might want to contact him directly and  ask him some questions.

My version of a buyout is attached.  I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to  foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about  500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,  this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000.  I have summarized our issues as follows:  1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:       Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment      Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR      2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475      3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417  2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit turn over.  3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).  4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x  debt coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.  5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.  6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:       Land -                   $1,121,670      Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000      Cash Equity              $1,419,268      Total                    $2,955,938  7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage  of actual hard construction costs.

First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in the transaction.  2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC)  will be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal.  3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as deferred profit has been acceptable.

They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.  AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.

Their version includes the salary of a  superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third  party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of \"construction management\"  fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be  paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally  the builders profit of 1.4 million.  Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out  of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if  they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?   We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition  to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been  in the cost estimates that we have been using.

If they can really build this  many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously  it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard  to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is  subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the  El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third consecutive day. The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening. But that still wasn't enough juice. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of $250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the $250/MWh price cap. The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the market at prices 10 times higher. Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000 megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts - for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said. The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. \"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\" Dorinson said. Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power. SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc 13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay Pwr Plant (This article was originally published Wednesday) LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif., Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said. The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday, 7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the ISO. The ISO manages grid reliability. As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling blackouts. The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE). Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.      -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc 13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-Line Power Plants (This article was originally published Wednesday)     By Jessica Berthold    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE) said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday evening. Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES and Dynegy Tuesday evening. AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said. Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives returned Wednesday for a full inspection.     AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits  The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, Thomas said. AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos and Redondo Beach plants. The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting. \"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,\" Thomas said. \"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality district's\" authority. As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.     Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC  Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line Wednesday. \"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'\" said Dynegy spokesman Lynn Lednicky. Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. \"We've been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"We even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\" Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of why its units were off line. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc   G_nther A.

The other wing would have a garage +  guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and  repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor  cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on  repairs.  2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite  manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has  interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager  that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a  management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager  onsite.  3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you  want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.  4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure  this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.  My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property  definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.

Cash Needs Highlights: SCE\u0001,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a complete  cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a  program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligations  and other measures.  Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE\u0001,s  available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51.8  million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash  conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. II. Credit Relationships Highlights: SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to  extend or renew credit as it has become due. At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE. SCE\u0001,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to default.  Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due and  payable. SCE\u0001,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond  indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more  indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE\u0001,s credit ratings on most of its  rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade  issues within the last three weeks. III. Energy Cost Scenarios Highlights This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess  various price scenarios upon SCE\u0001,s projected cash depletion dates. Under such  scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001. IV. Cost Containment Initiatives Highlights SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001. The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital  improvement component as follows (in millions): Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77 Capital Improvement Costs                383 Total                                             $ 460 The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to  be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming from  contract employees. Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the  most part being deferred to a future date. SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and  executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost  savings of approximately $92 million. V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA  Activity) Highlights: As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the  Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This  includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500  million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE\u0001,s  Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion. Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at the  end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit  balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to  D.01-01-018. Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from  generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are  tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as  expressed in the TRA, are overstated. TURN Proposal As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TURN  to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition assets.  Our comments are summarized as follows: The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that it  would not directly generate nor use cash. The Proposal\u0001,s impact on SCE\u0001,s balance sheet would initially be to shift  costs between two regulatory assets. TURN\u0001,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the  revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection in  the TRA is overstated. VI. Flow of Funds Analysis Highlights: In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a  positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to  its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion. Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its  shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding common  stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrative  and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. [there is no Section VII]   VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates SCE\u0001,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500  million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.  In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.  This increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially  complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with  the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (of  what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who  switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the  QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December  (and maybe earlier).  PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the  Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get  some assurances of payment.   SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due  on 2/2/01.  For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's  purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements  (Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be  resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this  occurred today.  Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will  happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.   Plan to meld together AB 1 with Hertzberg's new bill .  Hydro as security is  dead.

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the  forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a  supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.   \"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,\" said William Burson,  a trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\"   But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas  Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the  storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the  numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than  reality.   \"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what  we are reporting,\" McGill said.   As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --  and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing  fingers at Wall Street.   Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently  stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for  the rise in gas prices.   \"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik  told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.   In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric  utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.   Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame  for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their  customers and constituents from such price spikes.   Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take  precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price  insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas  prices before they soared.   \"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul  Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.   But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.   \"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to  change,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security  Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.    Hot topic   Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In  many circles, little else is discussed.   The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is  facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the  previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as  well.   The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of  his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial  pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.   \"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said.   A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per  thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile  to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by  customers.   But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand  cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage  for winter.   There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November,  prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information  Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating  bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.   But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,  including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas  markets.   \"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.   Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York  traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile  commodity in the world.    Setting the price   In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of  gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading  contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had  widespread influence over gas prices.   The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon  as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale  prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from  utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what  they pay for the gas they expect to use.   There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention  of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge  of natural gas.   But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to  know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all  futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to  their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money  in a short time.   As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less  than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10.  Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's  weekly storage numbers.   Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to  need in the winter.   Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than  average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in  hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.   Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be  sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the  concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.   Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage  numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the  association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.   But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice  president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had  continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.   \"I was getting worried,\" he said.   Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer.  Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices  dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.    Just passing through   Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but  pass their fuel costs on to customers.   Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas  charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas  Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.   Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last  month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could  be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve  energy.   Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to  save an average customer about $25 this winter.   Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an  extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not  guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.   Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left  customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether  they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel  costs.   On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public  Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to  perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices.   \"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It's time to consider  some changes.\"    To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to  severly@kcstar.com.     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star", "preview": "By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on ", "id": "enron_504"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["ina.rangel@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2001-01-22 00:38:00", "subject": "Re: Please respond", "body": "message board", "preview": "message board", "id": "enron_505"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["ina.rangel@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2001-01-22 00:34:00", "subject": "Re: Please respond", "body": "need help.", "preview": "need help.", "id": "enron_506"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["del@living.com"], "sent_at": "2000-12-06 04:41:00", "subject": "Re: Court Ordered Notice to Customers and Registered Users of living. com Regarding Sale of Information", "body": "please remove my name and information from the registered user list.

Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.  spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.   Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.   He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".   Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of  generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This  was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 12/29/2000 10:13 AM --------------------------- From: Steven J Kean@ENRON on 12/28/2000 09:19 PM ", "id": "enron_532"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["john.lavorato@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-12-28 05:19:00", "subject": "(no subject)", "body": "Trading Profits  P.

If  you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.          As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                     This creates a shortage in later months.   2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                         Specific questions should include:      1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage?    2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system.          I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less.   3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating  rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market  and the       consumer has benefitted.

Note that the construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.  Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.  It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.  I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are $1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3 bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.      - winmail.dat", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/17/2000 08:27 AM --------------------------- \"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 11/17", "id": "enron_562"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["paula.harris@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-11-16 06:51:00", "subject": "Re: West Gas 2001 Plan", "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/16/2000  02:51 PM --------------------------- To: Faith Killen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: West Gas 2001 Plan    Faith,   Regarding the 2001 plan, the members of the west desk are as follows:    Name   Title    Trading  Phillip Allen  VP  Mike Grigsby  Director  Keith Holst  Manager(possible Director)  Janie Tholt  Director  Steve South  Director  Frank Ermis  Manager  Tori Kuykendall  Manager  Matt Lenhart  Analyst(possible associate)  Monique Sanchez Commercial Support Manager  Jay Reitmeyer  Senior Specialist  Ina Rangel  Assistant (split costs with middle market)   Marketing   Barry Tycholiz  Director  Mark Whitt  Director  Paul Lucci  Manager (possible Director)  2-3 TBD  Do I need to give you the names of our operations group?

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).    According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.   Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount:\t$4.125 B Lenders:\t\tJP Morgan\t\t$2.5 B \t\t\tLehman Brothers\t\t$1.0 B \t\t\tBear Stearns\t\t$625 M Tax Exempt Portion:\tOf the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate:\tTaxable Rate\t\t5.77% \t\t\tTax-Exempt Rate\t\t4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:\t\t5.38% Maturity Date:\t\tAugust 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earlier in the crisis.   SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.    The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the DWR proportionately from rate payments.", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/07/2001 06:54 AM --------------------------- From: Kristin Walsh/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/04/200", "id": "enron_580"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["matthew.lenhart@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-11-01 03:34:00", "subject": "Generation", "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/01/2000  11:33 AM ---------------------------   Jeff Richter 10/20/2000 02:16 PM To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Generation  http://westpower.enron.com/ca/generation/default.asp", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/01/2000 11:33 AM --------------------------- Jeff Richter 10/20/2000 02:16 PM To: Phillip K Al", "id": "enron_581"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["bob.schorr@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-10-31 07:02:00", "subject": "Re: Approval for Plasma Screens", "body": "Bob,   Activate Plan B.

Crocker\"  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.  INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.  PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested.  I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.      At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell $172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.      \"What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.\"      Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees, and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.      Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.      \"Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.      At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased $206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.      PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled to restart this weekend.      At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at $325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.  -Robert Scalabrino   PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas       Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and falling natural gas prices, traders said.      The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $62.00-$76.00.      Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.      \"Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of the morning,\" said one PJM-based trader. \"By options expiration the market had pretty much dried up.\"      Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main reason for the decline in spot market prices.      Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of $2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts indicated reduced utility load requirements.      In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.      Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13 higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the $67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00- $92.00.      ~ -Karyn Rispoli   Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices       Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.      The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19 to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.      In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17 lower at $65.00-$100.00.      Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.      Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired generation to meet increased weather-related demand.      Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.      \"The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got people coming to their senses,\" one trader said. \"These are much more realistic prices.\"      Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00 yesterday.      Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.      \"What's happening is the people who don't have firm transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those high prices since they have no choice,\" one MAPP trader said.      \"Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices fell off,\" he said, \"and bought from them at those lower prices, causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.\"  -Ken Fahnestock   Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast       Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was forecast for the region this week, traders said.      Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.      \"There was nothing going on in Florida today,\" said one southern energy trader. \"Everything was going to markets in the north.\"      Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.      \"Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as forecasts came out,\" said on Entergy power trader. \"Prices, declined to $60 and less.\"      The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95 to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent estimates.      Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week caused prices to decline in the region.      In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was the main culprit behind lower prices.      \"The cold weather's backing off,\" said one SPP utility trader. \"It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.\"      Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.  -Brian Whary    U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand       London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.      The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01 pounds a megawatt-hour.      Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S.      Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15 pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.      December continued to fall amid a combination of position closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.      December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.      First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue to stifle demand, traders said.      January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.      First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.      Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer 2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour. Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a megawatt-hour.      Open positions on many short-term structures will likely force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run- up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more easily be assessed.  -Nick Livingstone   Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast       Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.      Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt- hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076 megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446 megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.      Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent reservoirs from overflowing.      Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for space heating.      Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders said.      \"The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,\" a Stockholm-based trader said. \"For too long, people have been selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.\"      Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S.      The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict temperatures to begin falling.      Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22 percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell 4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.      Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.      Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter- term contracts.      Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour, 1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.      Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers to meet the increased demand, other traders said.      Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor, will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.      Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.  -Nick Livingstone -0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT \u000f$    - daily.pdf", "preview": "Here is today's copy of Bloomberg Power Lines.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,  on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen, this is critical.

We've had  three meetings which brought out very different issues from different  traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to  be outside the scope of position consolidation.  Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to  make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this  project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this  project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and  work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all  drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan.  Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal  ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that  add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical,  transport, swaps, options, ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index, Physical gas for Nymex, Physical gas for Inside Ferc, Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,  on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.

Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on San Marcos that you received earlier. If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?  San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.  Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now.  If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will know more on this question later today.  Sincerely,  George W.

It appears that a single  buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above  market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades,  offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were  bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index  calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated  financial swaps for San Juan.   We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:   1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.    2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily.  It doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that  are dramatically different.    I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.

Crocker\"  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.  INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.

Crocker\"  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.

Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses  before the ultimate payout of profits?   Design and Construction    When will design be complete?   What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?   What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction  planning and permitting?   Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors,  vendors, and other professionals?   Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?   Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to  use? Names?  These questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor  in a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as much as possible from the process.

This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.

We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the  distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for  power quality reasons.  The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due  to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm  trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months  due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand,  Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude  awakening in the next 2-3 years. ---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000  03:41 PM ---------------------------     \tEnron North America Corp. \t \tFrom:  John D Suarez                           09/05/2000 01:45 PM \t  To: Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Dana Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul J  Broderick/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey Miller/NA/Enron@Enron cc:   Subject:    ---------------------- Forwarded by John D Suarez/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000 01:46  PM ---------------------------   George Hopley 09/05/2000 11:41 AM To: John D Suarez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Suresh Vasan/Enron Communications@ENRON  COMMUNICATIONS@ENRON cc:   Subject:   Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on                   Local Utilities                     ( September 05, 2000 )                      In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus                   Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in  Tukwila.                          The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and  computer servers for the                   region's growing number of dot-coms.                          Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up  construction                   on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than  a mile from its                   original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several  fiber optic backbones, the                   Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and  eventually                   house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,  Microsoft and Onvia.com.                          Exodus is not the only company building massive data  centers near Seattle.                   More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,  Globix and                   HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house  the networking                   equipment of the Internet economy.                          It is a big business that could have an effect on  everything from your                   monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access  your favorite Web sites.                         Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and  server farms, are                   sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent  Valley that some                   have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and  Puget Sound                   Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,  high-security                   facilities.                          \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that  are requesting 445                   megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\"  said Karl                   Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound  Energy. \"That is                   the equivalent of six oil refineries.\"                          A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,  the rise of the Internet                   data center has some utility veterans scratching their  heads.                          Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington  Utilities and                   Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new  data centers. The                   tariff is designed to protect the company's existing  residential and business                   customers from footing the bill for the new base stations  necessary to support                   the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20  million each,                   Karzmar said.                          Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to  bring up the data center                   issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                          For the utilities that provide power to homes,  businesses and schools in the                   region, this is a new and complex issue.                          On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing  appetite for power --                   represent potentially lucrative business customers. The  facilities run 24 hours a                   day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a  constant revenue                   stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that  they could                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital  expenditures.                          Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will  mean for power rates                   in the area is still open to debate.                          \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense  loads,\" said Bob Royer,                   director of communications and public affairs at Seattle  City Light.                          \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium  lights at the football                   game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.  We have data                   center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40  and 50 megawatts.\"                          With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate  complex in Tukwila is                   one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased  the 1.35 million                   square-foot Intergate East facility last September from  Boeing Space &                   Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased  92 percent of the                   six-building complex to seven different co-location  companies.                          \"It is probably the largest data center park in the  country,\" boasts Laurent                   Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG  Communications,                   NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama  Networks all                   lease space in the office park.                          After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,  Sabey has become an                   expert in the arena and now has facilities either under  management or                   development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole  claims his firm is                   one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in  the country.                          As more people access the Internet and conduct  bandwidth-heavy tasks                   such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for  co-location space in                   Seattle continues to escalate.                          But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center  space is growing at a                   rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,  causing similar                   concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and  California.                          Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location  space, plans to nearly                   double the amount of space it has by the end of the year.  While companies                   such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many  high-tech companies                   have decided to outsource the operations to companies such  as Exodus that                   may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic  management.                          \"We have 2 million square feet of space under  construction and we plan to                   double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more  demand right now                   than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account  executive at Exodus in                   Seattle.                          The booming market for co-location space has left some  in the local utility                   industry perplexed.                          \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do  to serve the growth,\"                   said Seattle City Light's Royer. \"The utility industry is  almost stunned by this, in                   a way.\"", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/06/2000 10:49 AM --------------------------- Jeff Richter 09/06/2000 07:39 AM To: Phillip K Al", "id": "enron_652"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["ina.rangel@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-09-06 03:46:00", "subject": "Re:", "body": "Ina,   Can you pull Tori K.'s and Martin Cuilla's resumes and past performance  reviews from H.R.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/06/2000  10:44 AM ---------------------------   John J Lavorato@ENRON 09/06/2000 05:39 AM To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re:    The commercial support people that you and Hunter want to make commercial  managers.", "preview": "Ina, Can you pull Tori K.'s and Martin Cuilla's resumes and past performance reviews from H.R. ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09", "id": "enron_653"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["john.lavorato@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-09-05 23:22:00", "subject": "Re:", "body": "resumes of whom?", "preview": "resumes of whom?", "id": "enron_654"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["ina.rangel@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-09-05 06:51:00", "subject": "RE: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence Program", "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000  01:50 PM ---------------------------   \"Christi Smith\" <christi.smith@lrinet.com> on 09/05/2000 11:40:59 AM Please respond to <christi.smith@lrinet.com> To: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com> cc: \"Debbie Nowak (E-mail)\" <dnowak@enron.com>  Subject: RE: Receipt of Team Selection Form - Executive Impact & Influence  Program   We have not received your completed Team Selection information.

We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team Selection information.  Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still require additional information.  We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.  So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need to instead, provide the needed information via email.  Thank you for your assistance Phillip.  Christi L.

Now that we have had several traders  managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss  any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu  (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they  will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this  meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is  comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those  who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have  heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to  discuss them.

If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS  information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed  as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days  ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to  call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.  With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees  between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to  have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee  data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the  year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC  requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their  profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education  need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is  accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to  hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com  on the command line of your browser.  The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.

The  WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,  which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes  the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but  there can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\"  generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule their  generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you  will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california  munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,  if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply  schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said  all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on  the generation side.  On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While  they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is  better than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the  load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.  I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with  others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas  demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,  especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the  UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal  consumer then it is obviously a different story.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be  an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is  O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to  get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and  I'll take care of it..  On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate  curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of  $235,019.    (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your  overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects  something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal  #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.   139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)   139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)   139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)   231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)   153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)  Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to  GDP-Kingsgate.   Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five  different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for  withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a  Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is  that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport  losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.   I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a  systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems  that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,  the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the  detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it  appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be  an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar  impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in  case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the  volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

They were polite regarding  asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to  listen to a proposal.  However, they are very interested in weather hedges to  protect throughput related earnings.  We are pursuing a confidentiality  agreement with them to facilitate the sharing of information that will enable  us to develop proposals.  Our pitch was based upon enhancing shareholder  value by outsourcing a non-profit and costly function (procurement) and by  reducing the volatility of their earnings by managing throughput via a  weather product.  As to your other question.  We have yet to identify or pursue other  candidates; however, Mike McDonald and I are developing a coverage strategy  to ensure that we meet with all potential entities and investigate our  opportunities.  We met with 8 entities this week (7 Municipals and SWG) as we  implement our strategy in California.  Are there any entities that you think would be interested in an asset  management deal that we should approach?  Otherwise, we intend to  systematically identify and work through all the candidates.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to  discuss asset management.  In preparation for that meeting we would like to  gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.   Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are  typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?   How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main  contacts at SW Gas?  We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our  control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably  have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the  commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their  commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)  should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month  index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That  risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of  their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.  As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are  there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly  appreciated.  Thanks,  Laird", "preview": "Laird, Did you meet with SWG on April 27th.

The data I have received thus far are summarized in the  following paragraphs.  The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or  curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.  The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations  or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.  A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a  lot of guesswork.  However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.

PIRA focuses on the  California/Southwest Region in its study of Natural Gas  Pipeline  Infrastructure  PIRA  Energy Group announces the continuation of its new multi-client study,  The  Price of Reliability: The Value and Strategy of Gas  Transportation.  The Price of Reliability, delivered in 6  parts (with each part representing  a discrete North American region), offers  insights into the changes and  developments in the North American natural gas  pipeline infrastructure. The  updated prospectus, which is attached in PDF and  Word files, outlines PIRA's  approach and methodology, study deliverables  and?release dates.  This note  is to inform you that PIRA has commenced its study of the third  region:  California & the Southwest. As in all regions, this  study begins  with a fundamental view of gas flows in the U.S. and Canada.  Pipelines in  this region (covering CA, NV, AZ, NM) will be discussed in greater  detail  within the North American context. Then we turn to the value of   transportation at the following three major pricing points with an assessment  of  the primary market (firm), secondary market (basis) and asset market:  ??????1) Southern  California border (Topock) ??????2) San Juan  Basin ??????3) Permian  Basin (Waha)?  The California/SW region\u0001,s  workshop \u0001* a key element of the service \u0001* will  take place on March 20, 2000,at 8:30 AM, at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in   Phoenix.?For those of you joining  us, a?discounted  block  of rooms is being  held through February 25.  The attached prospectus explains the various  options for subscribing.?Please  note  two key issues in regards to your subscribing options:?One, there is a  10% savings for  PIRA retainer clients who order before February 25, 2000;  and?two, there are discounts for  purchasing?more than one  region.

David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks.  Thank you, Mr. Moore.

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt- hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.      \"Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing prices to decline,\" said one Southwest trader.      According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.      At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank $202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.      Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.      At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.      According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling demand 84 percent below normal.      \"We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is causing temperatures to drop,\" said one Northwest trader.      At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at $175.00-$228.00.      According the California Independent System Operator today's forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743 megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.  -Robert Scalabrino   Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand       Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in available generation coupled with less weather-related demand, caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.      According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri, temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.      In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from Friday.      \"There's just no weather out there,\" said one PJM-based trader. \"There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week long.\"      Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000 megawatts through Friday.      Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to hit the grid tomorrow.      Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 nuclear power facilities.      The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1 at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned and operated by Niagara Mohawk.      Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to $58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to $51.25 and $40.00 indices.      ~ -Karyn Rispoli   Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up       Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast, traders said.      \"It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy to there,\" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said. \"Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of that.\"      The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25 when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.      Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00 and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.      Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at $28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee, forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.      \"Things should continue along these lines for the rest of the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,\" an ECAR trader said.      In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up, though traders said transmission problems limited volume.      Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50, and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with trades from $32.00-$40.00.      Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.      For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.      Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.      \"There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems getting power out of Ameren's grid too,\" one MAPP trader said. \"It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).\"  -Ken Fahnestock   Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up       Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.      Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5 degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is expected to begin Wednesday.      Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity, temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week, propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.       The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20. Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.      On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.      In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.      \"There's just no overnight load to do anything with the supply we have,\" said one Texas-based utility power trader. \"Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree (Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is 85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.\"      On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at $35-$36.      Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.      Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.      In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders said.      On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades were noted.  -Brian Whary   U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids       London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K. fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling interest, traders said.      Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than Friday.      The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting price levels, traders said.      Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.      June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.      On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15 pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since the start of last week.      Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements. Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels, they said.  -Amal Halawi   Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest       Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid limited hydro-supply, traders said.      Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00 megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50- 214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.      \"The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo- based trader said. \"I'm surprised that even at the peak of the snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are steadily climbing.''      Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters. Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a \"more realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet outlooks.''      Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour, down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was a \"high'' spot price for this time of the year.      Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour with 140 megawatts exchanged.      Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.  -Alejandro Barbajosa -0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT \u000f$    - daily.pdf", "preview": "Here is today's copy of Bloomberg Power Lines.

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is  reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into  the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.   Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of  contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).    According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.   Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.   Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis.   SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.    The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/07/2001 06:54 AM --------------------------- From: Kristin Walsh/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/04/200", "id": "enron_896"}, {"from": "critical.notice@enron.com", "recipients": ["ywang@enron.com", "patti.sullivan@enron.com", "phillip.k.allen@enron.com", "jane.m.tholt@enron.com", "mike.grigsby@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-12-12 04:53:00", "subject": "New Notice from Transwestern Pipeline Co.", "body": "Transwestern Pipeline Co. posted new notice(s) since our last check at  12/12/2000 12:18:01 PM, the newest notice looks like:   Capacity Constraint, Dec 12 2000 12:25PM, Dec 13 2000  9:00AM, Dec 14 2000   8:59AM, 2231, Allocation - SOCAL NEEDLES  Please click the following to go to the web site for detail.  http://ios.ets.enron.com/infoPostings/shared/et_noncritical_notice.asp?company =60", "preview": "Transwestern Pipeline Co. posted new notice(s) since our last check at 12/12/2000 12:18:01 PM, the newest notice looks like: Capacity Constraint, Dec 12 2000 12", "id": "enron_897"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["mike.grigsby@enron.com", "keith.holst@enron.com", "frank.ermis@enron.com", "jane.tholt@enron.com", "jay.reitmeyer@enron.com", "tori.kuykendall@enron.com", "matthew.lenhart@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2001-05-04 05:18:00", "subject": "Re: Western Wholesale Activities - Gas & Power Conf.

Current Notes User:  REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)  1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook  client will be configured on your computer. After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail  via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is  configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is  migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your  web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.  PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and  To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook  client is configured on your desktop.  2. Remote access to your mailbox. After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA)  for remote access to your mailbox.  PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while  connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA  available from your home or when traveling abroad.  HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)  Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:   http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe  Substitute \"john.doe\" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You  will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in \"corp/your user  id\" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You  will now be able to view your mailbox.     PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between  the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things  in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the  functions NOT available via OWA:  Features NOT available using OWA:  -  Tasks -  Journal -  Spell Checker -  Offline Use -  Printing Templates -  Reminders -  Timed Delivery -  Expiration -  Outlook Rules -  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall -  Sharing Contacts with others -  Task Delegation -  Direct Resource Booking -  Personal Distribution Lists  QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?  If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the  Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:   Outlook.2000@enron.com  Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:   713-853-1411  Thank you,  Outlook 2000 Migration Team", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/01/2001 02:14 PM --------------------------- Outlook Migration Team@ENRON 04/27/2001 01:01 PM ", "id": "enron_904"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["ina.rangel@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2001-05-01 07:14:00", "subject": "2- SURVEY/INFORMATION EMAIL", "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/01/2001  02:14 PM ---------------------------   Outlook Migration Team@ENRON 04/27/2001 01:00 PM To: Allison Horton/NA/Enron@ENRON, Amir Baig/NA/Enron@ENRON, Brandon  Bangerter/NA/Enron@Enron, Brian Ellis/Corp/Enron@Enron, Charles  Philpott/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Chris P Wood/NA/Enron@Enron, Chris  Tull/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dale Smith/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Dave June/NA/Enron@ENRON,  Donald Sutton/NA/Enron@Enron, Felicia Buenrostro/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Johnna  Morrison/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Joe Dorn/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kathryn  Schultea/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Leon McDowell/NA/Enron@ENRON, Leticia  Barrios/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Milton Brown/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Raj  Perubhatla/Corp/Enron@Enron, Shekar Komatireddy/NA/Enron@Enron, Andrea  Yowman/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Angie O'Brian/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Bonne  Castellano/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Gwynn Gorsuch/NA/Enron@ENRON, Jo Ann  Matson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, LaQuitta Washington/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Rick  Johnson/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sandra Lighthill/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Valeria A  Hope/HOU/ECT@ECT, Charlotte Brown/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ronald  Fain/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron@Enron, Anna  Harris/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Keith Jones/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kristi  Monson/NA/Enron@Enron, Bobbie McNiel/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, John  Stabler/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Michelle Prince/NA/Enron@Enron, James  Gramke/NA/Enron@ENRON, Blair Hicks/NA/Enron@ENRON, Jennifer  Johnson/Contractor/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Jim  Little/Enron@EnronXGate, Dale Lukert/NA/Enron@ENRON, Donald  Martin/NA/Enron@ENRON, Andrew Mattei/NA/Enron@ENRON, Darvin  Mitchell/NA/Enron@ENRON, Mark Oldham/NA/Enron@ENRON, Wesley  Pearson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Ramon Pizarro/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT,  Natalie Rau/NA/Enron@ENRON, William Redick/NA/Enron@ENRON, Mark A  Richardson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Joseph Schnieders/NA/Enron@ENRON, Gary  Simmons/NA/Enron@Enron, Delaney Trimble/NA/Enron@ENRON, David  Upton/NA/Enron@ENRON, Mike Boegler/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lyndel  Click/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Gabriel Franco/NA/Enron@Enron, Randy  Gross/HR/Corp/Enron@Enron, Arthur Johnson/HR/Corp/Enron@Enron, Danny  Jones/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, John Ogden/Houston/Eott@Eott, Edgar  Ponce/NA/Enron@Enron, Tracy Pursifull/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lance  Stanley/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Frank Ermis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jane M  Tholt/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jay Reitmeyer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Keith Holst/HOU/ECT@ect,  Matthew Lenhart/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike Grigsby/HOU/ECT@ECT, Monique  Sanchez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Randall L Gay/HOU/ECT@ECT,  Tori Kuykendall/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brenda H Fletcher/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeanne  Wukasch/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mary Theresa Franklin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike  Potter/NA/Enron@Enron, Natalie Baker/HOU/ECT@ECT, Suzanne  Calcagno/NA/Enron@Enron, Alvin Thompson/Corp/Enron@Enron, Cynthia  Franklin/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jesse Villarreal/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joan  Collins/HOU/EES@EES, Joe A Casas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kelly Loocke/ENRON@enronXgate,  Lia Halstead/NA/Enron@ENRON, Meredith Homco/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert  Allwein/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Loving/NA/Enron@ENRON, Shanna  Boudreaux/ENRON@enronXgate, Steve Gillespie/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Tamara  Carter/NA/Enron@ENRON, Tracy Wood/NA/Enron@ENRON, Gabriel Fuzat/Enron  Communications@Enron Communications, Jack Netek/Enron Communications@Enron  Communications, Lam Nguyen/NA/Enron@Enron, Camille Gerard/Corp/Enron@ENRON,  Craig Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jessica Hangach/NYC/MGUSA@MGUSA, Kathy  Gagel/NYC/MGUSA@MGUSA, Lisa Goulart/NYC/MGUSA@MGUSA, Ruth  Balladares/NYC/MGUSA@MGUSA, Sid Strutt/NYC/MGUSA@MGUSA cc:   Subject: 2- SURVEY/INFORMATION EMAIL  Current Notes User:   To ensure that you experience a successful migration from Notes to Outlook,  it is necessary to gather individual user information prior to your date of  migration.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that  the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large  part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which  the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman  began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or  answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had  some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce  demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would  export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty  strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner  out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and  if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the  agenda.  Hope this info helps.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.  March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand  over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for  temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates  into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as  compared with the previous year.  Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary  reductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other  forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making  total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.   This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple  more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%  decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the  retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it  is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last  year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in  Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation  are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of  meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general  economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least  make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.  Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area  only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC  (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO  portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in  demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As  you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum  smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at  least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its  wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several  mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are  sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly  how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.   Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's  economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of  the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I  think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already  realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the  non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the  WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around  6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.  I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you  with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I  hope this helps.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new  building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being  offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.  This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the  new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The  cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is  currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly  employee cost of $94.00.  If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to  the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made  as spaces become available.   The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be  opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street  level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available.  Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an  exit in the event of elevator trouble.   If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to  Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your  email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and  receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new  garage.  The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and  Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.   (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians,  will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/02/2001 02:49 PM --------------------------- Parking & Transportation@ENRON 03/28/2001 02:07 P", "id": "enron_963"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["stagecoachmama@hotmail.com"], "sent_at": "2000-12-07 06:23:00", "subject": "(no subject)", "body": "Lucy,  Here is a final 12/01 rentroll for you to save.

What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory  joist?  3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?  4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What  type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or  Cellulose?  5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?  6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know  the difference between an apron and a stool.  7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent  cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?  8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial  one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.  9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under  the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.  10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount  stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.  11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.  12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?  13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?  14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron  railings?  15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except  for change orders?

But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third consecutive day. The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening. But that still wasn't enough juice. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of $250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the $250/MWh price cap. The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the market at prices 10 times higher. Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000 megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts - for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said. The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. \"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\" Dorinson said. Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power. SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc 13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay Pwr Plant (This article was originally published Wednesday) LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif., Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said. The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday, 7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the ISO. The ISO manages grid reliability. As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling blackouts. The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE). Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.      -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc 13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-Line Power Plants (This article was originally published Wednesday)     By Jessica Berthold    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE) said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday evening. Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES and Dynegy Tuesday evening. AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said. Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives returned Wednesday for a full inspection.     AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits  The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, Thomas said. AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos and Redondo Beach plants. The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting. \"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,\" Thomas said. \"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality district's\" authority. As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.     Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC  Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line Wednesday. \"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'\" said Dynegy spokesman Lynn Lednicky. Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. \"We've been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"We even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\" Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of why its units were off line. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc   G_nther A.

According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.  Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however.  More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/15/2001 02:22 PM --------------------------- \"Arthur O'Donnell\" <aod@newsdata.com> on 03/15/20", "id": "enron_1002"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["kim.bolton@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2001-03-15 06:11:00", "subject": "RE: PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL COMPENSATION INFORMATION", "body": "Thanks for the information.

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and  existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company,  and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which  current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.  Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this  project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design  and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of  our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or  rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.?   Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a  percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on  your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%,  or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the  second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per  year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these  valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the  forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in  the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future  projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per  month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the  attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings  the total net buyout to $78,946.?   We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we  offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout  offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are  prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.?  If this is your     choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney,  Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then  draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the  Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout  amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.  Thank you.  ?  Sincerely,  [IMAGE]  ?  ?  ?  George W.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about  500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,  this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000.  I have summarized our issues as follows:  1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:       Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment      Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR      2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475      3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417  2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit turn over.  3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).  4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x  debt coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.  5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.  6.

First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in the transaction.  2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC)  will be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal.  3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as deferred profit has been acceptable.

They do not want the school to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today, and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.  AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.  The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer, and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the details to Wayne McCoy.

Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical  imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?  4.

If they can really build this  many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously  it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard  to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is  subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the  El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have  several people who have not left before 10:30 this week.  2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on  Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading  floor until after 5:00 p.m. 3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and  benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here  late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One  suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my  understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)  I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that Larry can get  the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books  like this and not lose good people.

I have shifted  to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could  not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more  towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One  wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3  kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage +  guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This  plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the  courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor  living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.   The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass  skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have  single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.    I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.

There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on  repairs.  2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite  manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has  interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager  that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a  management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager  onsite.  3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you  want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.  4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure  this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.  My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property  definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.   Sales Price  705,000  1st Lien   473,500  2nd Lien  225,000  Transfer fee    7,500  Cash required   14,500   NOI   100,000  1st Lien    47,292  2nd Lien   23,694  Cash flow  29,014  Cash on cash  200%   These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then  cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the  additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years  for a higher price.  Do you want to reconsider?  Let me know.

Cash Needs Highlights: SCE\u0001,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a complete  cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a  program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligations  and other measures.  Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE\u0001,s  available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51.8  million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash  conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. II. Credit Relationships Highlights: SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to  extend or renew credit as it has become due. At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE. SCE\u0001,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to default.  Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due and  payable. SCE\u0001,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond  indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more  indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE\u0001,s credit ratings on most of its  rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade  issues within the last three weeks. III. Energy Cost Scenarios Highlights This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess  various price scenarios upon SCE\u0001,s projected cash depletion dates. Under such  scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001. IV. Cost Containment Initiatives Highlights SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001. The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital  improvement component as follows (in millions): Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77 Capital Improvement Costs                383 Total                                             $ 460 The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to  be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming from  contract employees. Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the  most part being deferred to a future date. SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and  executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost  savings of approximately $92 million. V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA  Activity) Highlights: As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the  Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This  includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500  million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE\u0001,s  Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion. Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at the  end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit  balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to  D.01-01-018. Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from  generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are  tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as  expressed in the TRA, are overstated. TURN Proposal As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TURN  to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition assets.  Our comments are summarized as follows: The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that it  would not directly generate nor use cash. The Proposal\u0001,s impact on SCE\u0001,s balance sheet would initially be to shift  costs between two regulatory assets. TURN\u0001,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the  revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection in  the TRA is overstated. VI. Flow of Funds Analysis Highlights: In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a  positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to  its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion. Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its  shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding common  stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrative  and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. [there is no Section VII]   VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates SCE\u0001,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500  million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.  In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.  This increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.  I realize that what is budget and schedule  must be discussed and agreed upon.

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially  complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with  the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (of  what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who  switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the  QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December  (and maybe earlier).  PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the  Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get  some assurances of payment.   SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due  on 2/2/01.  For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's  purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements  (Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be  resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this  occurred today.  Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will  happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the  forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a  supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.   \"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,\" said William Burson,  a trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\"   But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas  Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the  storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the  numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than  reality.   \"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what  we are reporting,\" McGill said.   As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --  and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing  fingers at Wall Street.   Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently  stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for  the rise in gas prices.   \"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik  told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.   In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric  utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.   Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame  for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their  customers and constituents from such price spikes.   Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take  precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price  insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas  prices before they soared.   \"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul  Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.   But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.   \"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to  change,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security  Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.    Hot topic   Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In  many circles, little else is discussed.   The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is  facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the  previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as  well.   The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of  his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial  pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.   \"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said.   A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per  thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile  to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by  customers.   But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand  cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage  for winter.   There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November,  prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information  Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating  bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.   But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,  including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas  markets.   \"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.   Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York  traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile  commodity in the world.    Setting the price   In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of  gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading  contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had  widespread influence over gas prices.   The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon  as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale  prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from  utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what  they pay for the gas they expect to use.   There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention  of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge  of natural gas.   But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to  know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all  futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to  their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money  in a short time.   As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less  than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10.  Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's  weekly storage numbers.   Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to  need in the winter.   Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than  average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in  hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.   Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be  sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the  concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.   Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage  numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the  association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.   But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice  president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had  continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.   \"I was getting worried,\" he said.   Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer.  Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices  dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.    Just passing through   Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but  pass their fuel costs on to customers.   Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas  charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas  Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.   Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last  month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could  be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve  energy.   Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to  save an average customer about $25 this winter.   Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an  extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not  guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.   Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left  customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether  they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel  costs.   On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public  Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to  perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices.   \"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It's time to consider  some changes.\"    To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to  severly@kcstar.com.     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star", "preview": "By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on ", "id": "enron_1128"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["ina.rangel@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2001-01-22 00:38:00", "subject": "Re: Please respond", "body": "message board", "preview": "message board", "id": "enron_1129"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["paula.harris@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-11-17 04:04:00", "subject": "Re: West Gas Trading 2001 Plan", "body": "Paula,   I looked over the plan.

Note that the construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.  Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.  It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.  I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are $1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3 bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.      - winmail.dat", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/17/2000 08:27 AM --------------------------- \"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 11/17", "id": "enron_1141"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["james.steffes@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2001-01-12 05:18:00", "subject": "(no subject)", "body": "Jim,  Here are the key gas contacts.

Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.  spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.   Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.   He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".   Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of  generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This  was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 12/29/2000 10:13 AM --------------------------- From: Steven J Kean@ENRON on 12/28/2000 09:19 PM ", "id": "enron_1157"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["john.lavorato@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-12-28 05:19:00", "subject": "(no subject)", "body": "Trading Profits  P.

If  you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.          As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                     This creates a shortage in later months.   2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                         Specific questions should include:      1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage?    2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system.          I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less.   3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating  rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market  and the       consumer has benefitted.

Crocker\"  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.  INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.  PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested.  I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Earnings.com - News Earnings.com \t[IMAGE] \t \t     NT   5.92 -0.03    Nortel Networks Reports Results for Third Quarter 2001   TORONTO, Oct 18, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Nortel Networks Corporation(b) (NYSE:NT)(TSE:NT.):         --  Revenues from continuing operations: US$3.7 billion     --  Pro forma net loss(a) per share: US$0.68; before incremental         charges: US$0.27     --  Net loss from continuing operations: US$3.5 billion     --  Positive operating cashflow contributes to increase in cash to         US$3.4 billion    Nortel Networks Corporation(b) (NYSE:NT)(TSE:NT.) today reported results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2001 prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles.   Revenues from continuing operations were US$3.69 billion for the third quarter of 2001 compared to US$6.73 billion in the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third quarter of 2001, excluding incremental provisions and other charges, was US$854 million or US$0.27 per common share. Including the incremental provisions and other charges, pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third quarter of 2001 was US$2.18 billion, or US$0.68 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$597 million, or US$0.19 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000.   In the quarter, incremental charges included in the pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) were comprised of: US$750 million (pre-tax) for excess and obsolete inventory, primarily related to Optical Inter-City; US$767 million (pre-tax) for increased provisions related to trade receivables and customer financing; and US$380 million (pre-tax) primarily related to charges associated with certain third party investments. The Company also recorded: a US$801 million (pre-tax) charge for restructuring associated with the completion of the workforce reductions and facilities closures announced in June 2001; and a US$223 million (pre-tax) charge primarily related to the approximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of its Photonics Components business.   Including Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions and divestitures, and one-time gains and charges, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2001 of US$3.47 billion or US$1.08 per common share.   \"Revenues for the quarter reflected the challenges presented as the telecom industry adjusted to new levels of spending,\" said John Roth, president and chief executive officer Nortel Networks. \"Our bottom line results reflected the impact of actions we have taken to adjust to the new business levels. During the third quarter of 2001, Nortel Networks continued to aggressively implement its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. The Company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive break even at a quarterly revenue level well below US$4 billion. The structure is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002.\"   Frank Dunn, the Company's new president and chief executive officer effective November 1, 2001, said, \"Nortel Networks is focusing its investments and its organization to drive continued leadership across three businesses: Metro Networks, which encompasses metro optical networking, IP networking, IP services and voice over IP solutions for service providers and enterprises; Wireless Networks; and Optical Long Haul Networks. In the quarter, our product programs continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading portfolio of solutions. We also continued to work with our customers to help them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reductions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of opportunities for new revenue streams. Some key milestones over the past 120 days included:         --  the First North American ILEC began the circuit to packet         transition with the deployment of our carrier-grade         softswitch;     --  Announced Metro DWDM wins in the United States, Europe and         Japan;     --  Announced Multiservice backbone awards (ATM, IP, MPLS) in         China, Germany and Asia;     --  Continued progress on 3G Wireless Internet infrastructure         deployments and completed the first commercial UMTS test calls         and the first CDMA2000 1X mobile IP call;     --  Introduced advances in IP solutions, including an integrated         Layer 4-7 content switching capability on our Layer 2-3 Edge         Switch Router; and     --  Completed hardware design, significantly advanced software         integration and began production of OPTera Connect HDX         solution.\"    As announced on October 2, 2001, the Company expects to have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion of its work plan. Notifications to employees impacted by workforce reductions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of October 2001. A workforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Over the next few quarters, the Company also expects to continue to divest non-core businesses in accordance with its work plan. The number of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity (including the impact of divestures announced or completed to date) is expected to ultimately approach 10,000 positions.   Commenting on cash management in the quarter, Frank Dunn said, \"We are extremely pleased with the results that have been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a significant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operations. In addition, the Company further increased its financial flexibility by completing a highly successful US$1.8 billion convertible debt issue which, combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operations and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhanced our strong liquidity position. Given the industry correction and actions we have taken over the last two quarters, Nortel Networks balance sheet is well positioned.\"   \"While we believe we are beginning to see early indications that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainable levels, it still remains difficult to predict. In light of this and the uncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wake of the September 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and businesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time,\" concluded Dunn.         Revenue Breakdown from Continuing Operations    Network Infrastructure revenues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third quarter of 2000. Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada and slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline in Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Europe. Optical Inter-city revenues were down sharply in the United States, Europe and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia. Local Internet revenues were down substantially in the United States, Europe, Canada and Latin America, which were minimally offset by an increase in Asia.   Photonic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was largely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Inter-city solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000.   Other revenues declined 29 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Substantial growth in Global Professional Services in Europe and Asia, and strong growth in the United States, was more than offset by considerable declines in legacy voice solutions for corporations across all regions and wireless OEM revenues in most regions.   Commensurate with its announcement on October 2, 2001 to align its resources around three businesses (Metro Networks, Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks), Nortel Networks will evolve its financial reporting to reflect the new organization beginning in the fourth quarter of 2001.   Geographic revenues for the third quarter of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 decreased 54 percent in the United States, 53 percent in Canada and 30 percent outside the United States and Canada.         Nine-Month Results    For the first nine months of 2001, revenues from continuing operations were US$14.06 billion compared to US$19.75 billion for the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the first nine months of 2001 was US$4.01 billion, or US$1.26 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$1.57 billion, or US$0.51 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000. Including the net loss from discontinued access solutions operations, Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions and divestitures, one-time gains and charges, and the write down of intangible assets, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss of US$25.48 billion, or US$8.01 per common share, for the first nine months of 2001.         Spending Management    The Company continued to make rapid progress to reduce its cost structure. Compared to the Company's year-end 2000 cost structure, exclusive of incremental provisions and charges, the Company's cost structure at the end of the third quarter of 2001 is lower by approximately US$1 billion.         Gross Margin    Gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 1 percent reflecting incremental charges of approximately US$750 million related to excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the expected decrease in sales due to the continued downturn in the market. Excluding the impact of these incremental and other contract-related charges, gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 25 percent, compared to approximately 26 percent in the second quarter of 2001.         Expenses    Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were US$1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market adjustments and further decline in some of our of customers' financial condition resulted in incremental provisions of US$767 million in the quarter related to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental provisions in both periods, SG?expenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared to second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US$190 million.   Research and development (\"R&D\") expenses were US$808 million in the third quarter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments to drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the elimination of spending in all other areas. Compared to the second quarter of 2001, R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US$100 million, reflecting the impact of restructuring and streamlining operations.   The financial results of Nortel Networks Limited(b) (\"NNL\"), Nortel Networks Corporation's principal operating subsidiary, are fully consolidated into Nortel Networks results. NNL has preferred shares which are publicly traded in Canada. For the third quarter of 2001, NNL took a restructuring charge of US$793 million (pre-tax) associated with the completion of workforce reductions and the closure of certain facilities related to business streamlining; and recorded US$207 million (pre-tax) primarily related to the approximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of the Photonics Components business. All such amounts are included in the consolidated Nortel Networks amounts described above.

As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.   We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.   If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.   Thank you for your support.   Enron Global Technology       -----Original Message-----  From: Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON on behalf of Enron Messaging Administration  Sent: Mon 10/15/2001 9:15 PM  To: All Enron Worldwide@ENRON  Cc:  Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses    Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where \"name\" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.  Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.  To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any \"spaces\" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.  IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.  We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.  Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:  \tISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript). \tAny unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time). \tInformation related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).  All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.

It may be a top running back facing a sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a  premier cover-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense with ball-hawking safeties. We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups in every NFL game to  help you decide who to start and who to bench.

We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t     Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answer - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied.  \t     Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game.  \t     Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player.  \t       Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.   \t     This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

Interesting.  Ken  Indigestion  Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01   All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not. For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid.   Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen.   Studness determined that 79% of the \"new\" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand.   Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much.     Addressing a Burning Issue  If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.       WINNERS  \t\t\tSales* ($bil) \tRemarks  Calpine \t\t\t\t$4.6 \t\tIts gas power plants won't compete with coal for years  Chesapeake Energy \t\t0.9 \t\tHedged gas production through December 2003  Dynegy \t\t\t43.4 \t\tOwns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gas  Peabody Energy \t\t2.7 \t\tWorld's largest coal company   LOSERS  \t\t\tSales* ($bil) \tRemarks  Devon Energy \t\t\t3.3 Gas-heavy; \t$8 billion in ...debt   General Electric \t\t129.5 \t\tSells gas turbines  Pioneer Natural Resources \t1.0 \t\t$1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gas  Transocean SedcoForex \t1.9 \t\t$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure      *Latest 12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems.   \"It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,\" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. \"It's our game to displace older gas.\"   Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day.   That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are \"huge capital hogs,\" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says.   But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules.   Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.", "preview": "Don't know if you saw this already. Interesting.

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 percent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billion, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on equity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively affected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the September 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in certain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisions related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, insurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of the company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluated. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge includes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and asset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reorganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending in certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locations, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain processing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expected to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A portion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form of improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinvested back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the year and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million.   Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down 19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 percent. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   \"While we were on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terrorist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and investment activity slowed after September 11th,\" said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. \"In light of the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering initiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our businesses with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated benefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franchise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in the economy.\"   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net income of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also included in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-time costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist attacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last year.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee revenues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a 28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decrease in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel since September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarter was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offset a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance charge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yields. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introductory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinquencies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certain marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and business volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineering and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results \"on a managed basis\" as if there had been no securitization transactions, which conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS results on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both formats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 million after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. These gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   American Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago. Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claims directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net income would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA results reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, management and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, excluding the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securities, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduction reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfolio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) reported a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net income a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excluding these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximately double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB sustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these costs did not impact AEB's quarterly results.   AEB's business results reflect strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Results also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by higher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan balances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking.   Corporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 million a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million pre-tax ($7 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier.

Jeff  -----Original Message----- From: Mel Nelson [mailto:nelsonm@whitehallsd.k12.wi.us] Sent: Tuesday, October 23, 2001 7:06 AM To: Richter, Jeff Subject:    October 17, 2001  Jeff:  I talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in  having our class build a shed for you.  We pretty much make whatever you  would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are  durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner  is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only  charged for the materials.  Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most  economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a  given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar  style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have  usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2\" wide door opening.  I would think that  would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your  dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold  over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually  varies between $800 and $900.    Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is  a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum  soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe  Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize  and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your  dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though. The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently  building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up  door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be  roughly $1500.   We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your  needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the  easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday  October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to  finish that one on time.  If you have any questions just e-mail me or call: \tWhitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364 \tMy Home number 715-985-3063.  Have a good one and take with you later.

No hand-outs were provided.  Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity Topock  540 mmcf/d Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d Needles 800 mmcf/d Wheeler 800 mmcf/d  New Receipt Points Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d Both will be available around Feb 1  Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.  New Calculation, Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.  OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide 2 hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select  Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.    Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.   Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.  Scheduling Changes-Nov 1 Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.      Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.  2 Hour Notice Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free. OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.    Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.   Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage. No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO. Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal. Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.   If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules. Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.   If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:  Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.   For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.  For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:           Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2 Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1 Cycle 3\t\t\t\tevening cyle 2 on 10/4 Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4  In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.  Winter Balancing Rules Effective Nov 1-March 31 No changes. All customers must comply. Minimum delivery requirements 50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;) 70% of daily usage depending on storage level 70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min 90% of daily usage depending on storage level 90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min. Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect. Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule. Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,  Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.  Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.   Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group) Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.  2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.  Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement, Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.  Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.

Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt  In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc  \tAfter sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase: ?\tSmall story-line details (Example: company background, learner role) ?\tResources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report) ?\tOrder and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)  Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule.    Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable.

I spoke today with the Spring Valley building consultant and faxed him some detail.  There are a couple of possible problems he is looking at and we'll possibly need to get a variance from the decision makers when the time comes.  In the meantime, I printed out the earnest money contract and sellers disclosure forms from the website you found.  We are waiting on the final word from Spring Valley to move ahead.

This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.

Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.    Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.  I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.

Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt  In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc  \tAfter sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase: ?\tSmall story-line details (Example: company background, learner role) ?\tResources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report) ?\tOrder and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)  Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule.    Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock.   Thanks.

Wouldn't you know it: the house is already occupied... by  ghosts (13 of them!) with a decidedly deadly agenda. Also new this  weekend: when a seemingly normal man (Kevin Spacey) announces he's from another  planet, it's up to his psychiatrist (Jeff Bridges) to find out exactly what's  behind his strange story in the drama K-PAX .  N'Sync boys Lance Bass and Joey Fatone swap music for movies in  On  the Line , and Snoop Dogg is a ghost  determined to clean up his old neighborhood in  Bones .    Coming Soon: Monsters, Inc.

You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t     Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  \t     Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  \t     Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  \t       Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.  \t     This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

Have a safe and happy holiday season!     Deadline for Converting to a Roth IRA  December 31, 2001 is your deadline for converting a Traditional  IRA to a Roth IRA. You should consult with a tax professional  or accountant to help you determine if a conversion is advantageous  for you. For assistance, please call 1-800-934-4448, press  4 then 4 to speak with a Retirement Plans Specialist.  Restraints  Will Be Overcome  We see an  irregular upward trend in the market.  Stocks  face some formidable hurdles. The risk of additional terrorism  and fresh memories of the market's 18-month downward spiral are  inhibiting buying. So are dismal fourth-quarter earnings pre-announcements  as the economic cycle approaches bottom, as well as continued  high P/E ratios on recession-depressed profits. In addition, the  supply of stock for sale at prices just above current levels is  heavy, according to technical analysts.   But  we expect that these and other impediments will be overcome. And  we note that market recoveries that proceed in halting fashion  amid widespread skepticism often are the most sustainable.  Congress's  failure to pass a fiscal stimulus bill is not a major negative,  according to S&P chief economist David Wyss. The economy will  recover anyway, says Wyss, with absence of the package pinching  GDP growth in 2002 by only 0.2%. Without fiscal stimulus, the  chances of a 12th fed funds rate cut on January 30 are improved.    Based  on Wyss's forecast of GDP turning positive in the first quarter  and improving to an annual growth rate of 5% in the fourth quarter,  investors should be getting more encouraging news before long.    The  recent rally lost upward momentum when it bumped up against overhead  resistance at 1170 on the S&P 500 on December 5. With the  help of turn-of-the-year reinvestment demand, the next attempt  to work through this supply is likely to be more successful, says  Mark Arbeter, S&P chief technical analyst. But even if it  is, the area of resistance runs all the way up to 1313, so Arbeter  believes further progress in the period ahead will be labored.    We  think the S&P 500 and Nasdaq will see double-digit gains over  the course of 2002. A portfolio allocation of 65% stocks, 20%  bonds and 15% cash reserves remains appropriate.

(AND WHERE TO GET HELP IN A PINCH)      The week between Christmas and New Year's          is traditionally vacation time in Silicon          Valley, so we're taking the week off, too.          In the meantime, here are some places you can          get computer help over the holidays. And if          you really, really miss me, I've also linked          to my most popular columns of 2001.  http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1224/2834324:8593142     PLUS: MY 2001 FAVORITES: PRODUCTS THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR ME   http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1224/2834332:8593142  #   _____________________NEWS ANALYSIS_____________________  Patrick Houston      HO, HO, HO! WHY CHRISTMAS 2002 WILL BE JOLLY, BY GOLLY      While this is a muted Christmas for most     of us, it's been a merry one indeed for     e-tailers. Pat thinks that if this holiday     generated so much holiday cheer, just     wait 'til next year. That's when some     enabling technologies will make online     shopping far more than the glorified     catalog-buying experience it is now.   http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1224/2834303:8593142      _____________________EXPERT ADVICE_____________________   Adrian Mello    WHY YOU'RE STILL NOT GIVING CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY WANT     The Internet promised to make \"mass customization\"          a reality. But so far it hasn't worked out that          well. Reason: It's simply too costly. But          is there some way your business can create          tailor-made goods for even broad markets?          Adrian thinks so--but it's going to be tricky.    http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1224/2834200:8593142   \t\t\t> > > > >   Larry Dignan    BUILDING AN E-GOVERNMENT: IT'LL BE HARD, BUT IT'LL HELP IT     Will the government ever go paperless? It          looks like in 2002 it might start. Such an undertaking          would boost government spending and give          tech businesses a much-needed shot in the          arm. But it won't be easy. Larry explains why          it'll be so challenging to bring the government          into the wired world.   http://cgi.zdnet.com/slink?/adeskb/adt1224/2833836:8593142   \t\t\t> > > > >   Preston Gralla    WEB GRAPHICS MADE EASY: 3 TOOLS THAT DO YOUR DIRTY WORK     Creating graphics for your Web site doesn't          have to be a pain in the neck.

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.  NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.  Turret Users An \"Alliance MX turret quick reference guide\" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as \"Caller ID\" and \"Voicemail Indication\".  Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50\" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:  Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:   Channel\tAvaya\tStentophon\t Weather Channel\t12401\t801\t CNN Headlines News\t12402\t802\t CNN Financial News\t12403\t803\t CNBC\t12404\t804\t MSNBC\t12405\t805\t Bloomberg\t12406\t806\t Financial News Network\t12407\t807\t CNN\t12408\t808\t Fox Sports\t12409\t809\t ESPN1\t12410\t810\t   Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the \"Gridiron Guru.\"   \t[IMAGE]\tInside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   \t    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  \t       Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  \t       Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  \t       Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t     Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  \t     Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   \t     Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   \t       Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.    \t     This message has been sent to pallen@enron.com, provided free of charge and free of obligation.

It was  introduced back in 1983 as a boxy hatchback and sedan that quickly became  known for its eminent practicality and bulletproof reliability. Subsequent  generations became larger and more powerful, with the Camry line expanding  to include a wagon and a coupe. Toyota designed it to appeal to as many  buyers as possible, and buyers responded by making the Camry one of  America's best-selling vehicles.   For 2002, the Camry has been completely redesigned on a brand-new platform.  The new generation is being sold solely as a four-door sedan, although last  year's Camry Solara continues as a coupe and convertible. Toyota claims  that the new Camry's design is both sportier and more personal than the  sedans that came before. We evaluated a Camry XLE to find out if Toyota hit  its mark.

Just login at  tdwaterhouse.com , click on 'News & Research', and then  on 'Goldman Sachs'.  Gradual  Uptrend Anticipated By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook   We see further  but slower market progress.  Tired  after their recent run, stocks nevertheless are being supported  by signs that the economy is stabilizing, better news from Afghanistan  and a large pool of cash reserves earning meager returns. The  two-steps-forward, one-step-backward recovery since September  21 hasn't created the enthusiasm that would necessitate an early,  nasty correction. Investors, keeping in mind that every rally  of the past 19 months has ultimately failed, are regaining their  confidence only slowly.  Background  conditions don't lend themselves to a strong advance in the near  term. While recent data suggest that the recession will be mild  and will end early next year, risks to this forecast are high.  Another terrorist attack could deepen consumer gloom. The possibility  of the disruption of oil supplies still exists. The fiscal stimulus  package continues to be bogged down in partisan bickering.   Treasury  bond yields, moreover, have turned sharply higher, spurred by  the less dire economic reports and by chart breakouts. Yields  have quickly retraced the September-October decline.  S&P  technical analyst Mark Arbeter is impressed by the recent stock  market action and anticipates higher levels over the intermediate  term, but he believes the easiest and quickest gains are behind.  Arbeter sees a likely substantial amount of stock for sale when  Nasdaq (currently at 1898) moves into the 1920 to 2300 range and  the S&P 500 (now at 1139) reaches 1170 to 1300. He expects  it will take time to chew through this supply.  History  also suggests limited near-term upside potential. Three months  after the low points of the nine postwar bear markets, the S&P  500 was up an average of 14.9%. The index is already up 18% since  the September 21 low. Six months after the nine postwar bear market  lows, however, the \"500\" showed an average gain of 24.4%;  12 months after the lows, the index was ahead 34.5%, on average.

Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.   HOW TO ENROLL:      1.  Print out the attached registration form.      2.  Complete the form, but please note the following           SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:           A.

In the Enrollment section, where it says \"Please enroll                me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________\",           C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the                tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.

Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.  IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:      The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially improve in a short period of time.  THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:      All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.

Bob  ----- Original Message ----- From: <Phillip.K.Allen@enron.com> To: <wise.counsel@lpl.com> Sent: Wednesday, November 14, 2001 8:19 AM Subject: RE: word file as promised   Bob,  I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be on January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing, the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression that yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.  On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful suggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new space.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use the new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the existing play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be used for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would not have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you could slope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place a large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up. >From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below the addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the driveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the house so that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen to the living room or dining room would still be possible.  Personally, I think opening the dining room would be the better idea.  I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in exploring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest something in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me to try and sketch out these ideas.  Phillip       -----Original Message-----      From:   \"Robert W.

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.  After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.

The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the \"Gridiron Guru.\"   \t[IMAGE]\tInside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   \t    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  \t       Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  \t       Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  \t       Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t     Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  \t     Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  \t     Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  \t       Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.  \t     This message has been provided free of charge and free of obligation.

We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.  ?\tClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service. ?\tMatching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.  We regret that we have had to make these changes.

I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.  We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.    I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.

David  -----Original Message----- From: \tAllen, Phillip K.   Sent:\tMonday, November 26, 2001 11:18 AM To:\tOxley, David Subject:\tRE: Answer   David,  For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.    Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states \"Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?\".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of \"a single sum distribution\" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.  Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.  Phillip     -----Original Message----- From: \tOxley, David   Sent:\tMonday, November 26, 2001 8:31 AM To:\tAllen, Phillip K. Cc:\tWhalley, Greg; Joyce, Mary Subject:\tAnswer   For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a \"single sum distribution,\" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.    Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.  Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.          Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.", "preview": "Pam, Can you help with below?

We  See Upswing Continuing   By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook   Selective  accumulation remains in order.  The  early stages of recoveries from bear markets vary widely in degree.  As time passes, however, deviations from the norm become far less  dramatic.   Through  last Wednesday, when we went to press early because of the holiday,  31% of the bear market loss from March 27, 2000 to September 21,  2001 had been recaptured. That's about average for rebounds in  the postwar period. As shown in the table at the bottom right  of this week's edition of The Outlook, at the two-month point  in the recoveries from the nine former bear markets since World  War II, the S&P 500 had won back an average of 33% of the  bear market loss.   In  each of the nine instances, the gain at the end of six months  was greater than that after two months and the gain at the end  of 12 months was greater than that after six months. On average,  nearly two-thirds of the bear market loss was recovered after  six months and almost all of the bear market loss was recouped  in a year.  Economic  and corporate news will remain bad for a while, but that's typically  the case in the early part of a bull market that is associated  with an economic recession. Stock prices start recovering well  before the headlines improve. The September upturn in stocks would  be consistent with the start of an economic expansion in the first  quarter of next year.   While  P/E ratios currently are high, that won't necessarily keep the  bull market from progressing. The preceding economic expansion  was the longest in history and gave rise to \"new era\"  optimism. Corporations, especially in information technology,  built production and sales capacity to levels far greater than  proved justified. Those excesses are now being corrected, painfully.  Corporate earnings are in a severe contraction. Once the economy  begins to grow again, however, profits will rebound and P/Es will  start looking much more reasonable. Low inflation, low interest  rates, rapid technological innovation and above-average productivity  growth should help support elevated stock valuations.

Cc:\tMcDaniel, Kirk; Coleman, Brad; O'rourke, Tim Subject:\tBRM Case & Options Importance:\tHigh  Phillip,  I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around.   Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses. One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM \"core\" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.

We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the Knowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type.  2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content for these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next week to gather content and a second meeting for review.  3. We will change \"Gas Daily Risk\" to \"Intra-Month Risk\" throughout the simulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk?  4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too?

We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line.  We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away.  To our IBS Billpayer clients:  During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence (and support).  Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account information, please refer to the following information:  1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message \"You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.\" This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #.  2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:  Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always remember that your password is case sensitive.  Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying) ordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.

Sent:\tFriday, November 16, 2001 8:38 AM To:\tWhalley, Greg; Lavorato, John Subject:\tFW:    Greg,  After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account.    Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.  There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with \"notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.\"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating \"a single sum distribution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts\" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.  The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states \"The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock\".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.  The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:     Section 6.3\t\tPlan Administrators\t\tSection 7.1  Number of shares\t\t6,600\tshares\t\t6,600\tshares\t\t\t6,600 shares Relative share price\t\t$27.23\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$83.13 Phantom Stock Value\t\t$179,718\t\t\t\t\t\t$548,658 10% Penalty\t\t\t-17,972\t\t\t -600\t\t\t\t-54,866 Value to be distributed\t\t$161,746\t\t6,000 shares\t\t\t$493,792 Current stock price\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$10 Distribution\t\t\t$161,746\t\t6,000 shares\t\t\t49,379 shares  I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.     In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.  Sincerely,   Phillip Allen", "preview": "Wow! this looks complicated. let me get some help on this and get back to you -----Original Message----- From: Allen, Phillip K.

The fact that it is still \"truck-based\" - which essentially refers to the  full-frame construction that makes its Yukon big brother such a beefy  workhorse - does not mean that this SUV rides like a truck. Quite the  contrary, the Envoy is smooth and refined in a way that would have been  unthinkable just a few years ago. Of course, the market in which the Envoy  competes has become packed with excellent choices, with everyone from Acura  to Mercury entering the fray.

We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team Selection information.  Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still require additional information.  We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.  So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need to instead, provide the needed information via email.  Thank you for your assistance Phillip.  Christi L.

We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team Selection information.  Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still require additional information.  We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.  So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need to instead, provide the needed information via email.  Thank you for your assistance Phillip.  Christi L.

The utility infrastructure simply cannot handle these loads at the  distribution level and ultimatley distributed generation will be required for  power quality reasons.  The City of Austin, TX has experienced 300+ MW of load growth this year due  to server farms and technology companies.  There is a 100 MW server farm  trying to hook up to HL&P as we speak and they cannot deliver for 12 months  due to distribution infrastructure issues.  Obviously, Seattle, Porltand,  Boise, Denver, San Fran and San Jose in your markets are in for a rude  awakening in the next 2-3 years. ---------------------- Forwarded by Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000  03:41 PM ---------------------------     \tEnron North America Corp. \t \tFrom:  John D Suarez                           09/05/2000 01:45 PM \t  To: Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Dana Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul J  Broderick/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey Miller/NA/Enron@Enron cc:   Subject:    ---------------------- Forwarded by John D Suarez/HOU/ECT on 09/05/2000 01:46  PM ---------------------------   George Hopley 09/05/2000 11:41 AM To: John D Suarez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Suresh Vasan/Enron Communications@ENRON  COMMUNICATIONS@ENRON cc:   Subject:   Internet Data Gain Is a Major Power Drain on                   Local Utilities                     ( September 05, 2000 )                      In 1997, a little-known Silicon Valley company called Exodus                   Communications opened a 15,000-square-foot data center in  Tukwila.                          The mission was to handle the Internet traffic and  computer servers for the                   region's growing number of dot-coms.                          Fast-forward to summer 2000. Exodus is now wrapping up  construction                   on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than  a mile from its                   original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several  fiber optic backbones, the                   Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and  eventually                   house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A,  Microsoft and Onvia.com.                          Exodus is not the only company building massive data  centers near Seattle.                   More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet,  Globix and                   HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house  the networking                   equipment of the Internet economy.                          It is a big business that could have an effect on  everything from your                   monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access  your favorite Web sites.                         Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and  server farms, are                   sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent  Valley that some                   have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and  Puget Sound                   Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour,  high-security                   facilities.                          \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that  are requesting 445                   megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\"  said Karl                   Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound  Energy. \"That is                   the equivalent of six oil refineries.\"                          A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business,  the rise of the Internet                   data center has some utility veterans scratching their  heads.                          Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington  Utilities and                   Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new  data centers. The                   tariff is designed to protect the company's existing  residential and business                   customers from footing the bill for the new base stations  necessary to support                   the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20  million each,                   Karzmar said.                          Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to  bring up the data center                   issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting.                          For the utilities that provide power to homes,  businesses and schools in the                   region, this is a new and complex issue.                          On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing  appetite for power --                   represent potentially lucrative business customers. The  facilities run 24 hours a                   day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a  constant revenue                   stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that  they could                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital  expenditures.                          Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will  mean for power rates                   in the area is still open to debate.                          \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense  loads,\" said Bob Royer,                   director of communications and public affairs at Seattle  City Light.                          \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium  lights at the football                   game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day.  We have data                   center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40  and 50 megawatts.\"                          With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate  complex in Tukwila is                   one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased  the 1.35 million                   square-foot Intergate East facility last September from  Boeing Space &                   Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased  92 percent of the                   six-building complex to seven different co-location  companies.                          \"It is probably the largest data center park in the  country,\" boasts Laurent                   Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG  Communications,                   NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama  Networks all                   lease space in the office park.                          After building Exodus' first Tukwila facility in 1997,  Sabey has become an                   expert in the arena and now has facilities either under  management or                   development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole  claims his firm is                   one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in  the country.                          As more people access the Internet and conduct  bandwidth-heavy tasks                   such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for  co-location space in                   Seattle continues to escalate.                          But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center  space is growing at a                   rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country,  causing similar                   concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and  California.                          Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location  space, plans to nearly                   double the amount of space it has by the end of the year.  While companies                   such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many  high-tech companies                   have decided to outsource the operations to companies such  as Exodus that                   may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic  management.                          \"We have 2 million square feet of space under  construction and we plan to                   double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more  demand right now                   than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account  executive at Exodus in                   Seattle.                          The booming market for co-location space has left some  in the local utility                   industry perplexed.                          \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do  to serve the growth,\"                   said Seattle City Light's Royer. \"The utility industry is  almost stunned by this, in                   a way.\"", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/06/2000 10:49 AM --------------------------- Jeff Richter 09/06/2000 07:39 AM To: Phillip K Al", "id": "enron_1620"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["ina.rangel@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2000-09-06 06:04:00", "subject": "(no subject)", "body": "Ina,   I scheduled a meeting with Jean Mrha tomorrow at 3:30", "preview": "Ina, I scheduled a meeting with Jean Mrha tomorrow at 3:30", "id": "enron_1621"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["retwell@sanmarcos.net"], "sent_at": "2000-09-06 07:00:00", "subject": "(no subject)", "body": "Larry,   Just a note to touch base on the sagewood townhomes and other development  opportunities.

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond requirement, I used this data to be cautious.  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University. As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences. The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan. This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San Antonio if you do not know anyone. I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker, by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery. Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you on this project that is sure to be a major winner. I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes. One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as if she will be ok in the long run. George W.

We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan.  This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his sales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

As you can tell from the proforma this project should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years. This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we have uncovered to date in the Austin market. The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As it is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street widening.

Is the closing today?? After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding  as far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like  anything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate  closing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.?  ? If this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is  no point in me  following up on this?document's validity.?  ? I will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and  find out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can. ? I guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable  document or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.?  This isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last  night but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said  this is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.?  ? I will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at  that but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even  needed to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any  need to contact me regarding the  closing. ? I really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself  and I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't  seem to be something required for a closing.?

Crocker\"  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.  INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.  PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested.  I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.  INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.  PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested.  I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Investor's Alliance says that these demographics are similar to the package on San Marcos that you received earlier. If there are any other questions or information requirements, let me know. Then, let me know your interest level in the Westgate project?  San Marcos The property across the street from the Sagewood units in San Marcos is for sale and approved for 134 units.  The land is selling for $2.50 per square foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.  Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25 per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and $1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects, just as the duplexes do now.  If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there is a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not yet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will know more on this question later today.  Sincerely,  George W.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;  the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,  on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic  consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time  consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the  inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the  consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can  arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to  happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the  consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude  building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the  future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm  requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project  plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.  The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to  themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this  project.  I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been  good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now  we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

We've had  three meetings which brought out very different issues from different  traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader  requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements. We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to  be outside the scope of position consolidation.  Things left to do: I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to  make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this  project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope. Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this  project and which fall out of scope. For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and  work with traders to define the exact requirements of each. Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all  drill downs. Use the above to formulate a project plan.  Things requested thus far (no particular order): Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal  ticker. Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that  add up existing position manager rows/columns). New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical,  transport, swaps, options, ... Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values  of all curves on which the desk has a position. Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be  shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid  would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid. Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the  appropriate positions to show for each: Gas Daily for monthly index, Physical gas for Nymex, Physical gas for Inside Ferc, Physical gas for Mid market. Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of  using official valuations. Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks. Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS: Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility  skew and correlations. Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a  gamma grid. Valuation of Gas Daily options. A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD. Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets. Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position  manager. Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms,  prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change. Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker. Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of  individual deals on the position total in a grid cell. Benchmark positions in TDS. Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit  and explicit position break out issues.  -- Allan.  PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for  transport.

Crocker\"  <clclegal2@aol.com>  Subject: Investment Structure   STRUCTURE: Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC) general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the liability of construction.  LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits is reduced.  All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments, the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non-recourse.  USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering & architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated 6 month design and approval period.  EARLY LAND COSTS The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.  EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as the \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds.  The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000 per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000 which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.  Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint.  CONSTRUCTION LOANS There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.  Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will be from 80% to 95% of value.  DISBURSEMENTS Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs. These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership. Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.  REPORTING We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan. What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based reporting.  BOOKKEEPING I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.  INVESTOR INPUT We are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every effort to be accommodating.  CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally, for vendors they are constantly shopped.  PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can provide these if you are interested.  I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.  Call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.

Note that the construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.  Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.  It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.  I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are $1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3 bedroom.  Additional revenues could be generated by building detached garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.      - winmail.dat", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/17/2000 08:27 AM --------------------------- \"George Richards\" <cbpres@austin.rr.com> on 11/17", "id": "enron_1688"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["pallen70@hotmail.com"], "sent_at": "2000-11-28 09:48:00", "subject": "rent roll", "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 11/28/2000  05:48 PM ---------------------------   \"Lucy Gonzalez\" <stagecoachmama@hotmail.com> on 11/28/2000 01:02:22 PM To: pallen@enron.com cc:   Subject: rent roll    ______________________________________________________________________________ _______ Get more from the Web.

But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third consecutive day. The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening. But that still wasn't enough juice. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of $250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the $250/MWh price cap. The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the market at prices 10 times higher. Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000 megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts - for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said. The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency, which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps. The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing. But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources. \"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\" Dorinson said. Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high-priced power. SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc 13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay Pwr Plant (This article was originally published Wednesday) LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif., Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said. The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday, 7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the ISO. The ISO manages grid reliability. As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling blackouts. The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE). Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.      -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872; jessica.berthold@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc 13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-Line Power Plants (This article was originally published Wednesday)     By Jessica Berthold    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons. The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said. The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so. As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE) said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday evening. Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES and Dynegy Tuesday evening. AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said. Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives returned Wednesday for a full inspection.     AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits  The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed, Thomas said. AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos and Redondo Beach plants. The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company $20 million for polluting. \"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,\" Thomas said. \"It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality district's\" authority. As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.     Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC  Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line Wednesday. \"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'\" said Dynegy spokesman Lynn Lednicky. Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired. \"We've been doing all we can to get back in service,\" Lednicky said. \"We even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.\" Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of why its units were off line. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00 1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc   G_nther A.

The approximate amount of load relief achieved due to conservation or  curtailments over the Peak period on December 12 was 835 MWh.  The approximate amount of generation increase due to extraordinary operations  or purchases over the Peak period on December 12 was 786 MWh.  A note of caution, these figures are very imprecise and were derived with a  lot of guesswork.  However, they should be within the ballpark of reality.

The book covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.  I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily - interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings, structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash -  structures that have lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good background information for sustainable builder folks.  Thank you, Mr. Moore.

According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal for the next seven days. In the Southwest temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.      At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell $172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.      \"What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were supposed to have,'' said one Northwest power marketer. Since the weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.\"      Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees, and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.      Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.      \"Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices to fall,'' said one Northwest power trader.      At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased $206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.      PSC of New Mexico's 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled to restart this weekend.      At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at $325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.  -Robert Scalabrino   PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas       Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and falling natural gas prices, traders said.      The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $62.00-$76.00.      Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. forecast tomorrow's high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today's expected high. Temperatures could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.      \"Most of the day's activity took place in the early part of the morning,\" said one PJM-based trader. \"By options expiration the market had pretty much dried up.\"      Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main reason for the decline in spot market prices.      Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of $2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts indicated reduced utility load requirements.      In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.      Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13 higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the $67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00- $92.00.      ~ -Karyn Rispoli   Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices       Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.      The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19 to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.      In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17 lower at $65.00-$100.00.      Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.      Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired generation to meet increased weather-related demand.      Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.      \"The weather's moderating and gas is down, so you've got people coming to their senses,\" one trader said. \"These are much more realistic prices.\"      Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00 yesterday.      Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.      \"What's happening is the people who don't have firm transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those high prices since they have no choice,\" one MAPP trader said.      \"Then you've got some people who were lucky enough to get a firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices fell off,\" he said, \"and bought from them at those lower prices, causing the huge gap between the day's high and low trade.\"  -Ken Fahnestock   Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast       Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was forecast for the region this week, traders said.      Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.      \"There was nothing going on in Florida today,\" said one southern energy trader. \"Everything was going to markets in the north.\"      Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.      \"Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as forecasts came out,\" said on Entergy power trader. \"Prices, declined to $60 and less.\"      The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95 to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent estimates.      Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week caused prices to decline in the region.      In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was the main culprit behind lower prices.      \"The cold weather's backing off,\" said one SPP utility trader. \"It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and today it's about 9 degrees with the wind chill.  Yesterday, it was bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.\"      Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.  -Brian Whary    U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand       London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.      The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01 pounds a megawatt-hour.      Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S.      Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15 pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.      December continued to fall amid a combination of position closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.      December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday's last trade.      First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue to stifle demand, traders said.      January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.      First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.      Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer 2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour. Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a megawatt-hour.      Open positions on many short-term structures will likely force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run- up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more easily be assessed.  -Nick Livingstone   Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast       Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.      Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt- hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday's closing trade on 1,076 megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446 megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.      Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent reservoirs from overflowing.      Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for space heating.      Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders said.      \"The market's been waiting for this day for a long time,\" a Stockholm-based trader said. \"For too long, people have been selling because winter hasn't lived up to expectations. We should now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.\"      Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S.      The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict temperatures to begin falling.      Thursday's system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22 percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell 4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.      Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.      Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter- term contracts.      Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour, 1.9 kroner below yesterday's last trade at 135.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.      Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers to meet the increased demand, other traders said.      Vattenfall's Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor, will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.      Today's rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used today's news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.  -Nick Livingstone -0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT \u000f$    - daily.pdf", "preview": "Here is today's copy of Bloomberg Power Lines.

If  you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.          As far as recommendations, here is a short list:   1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales  above monthly index without enough consideration of future        replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be  injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.                     This creates a shortage in later months.   2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet  demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.                         Specific questions should include:      1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order  to fill storage?    2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too  much gas from Socal's system.          I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their  own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than  their injection capablity, but injected far less.   3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short  term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major                      LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating  rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market  and the       consumer has benefitted.

In attendance were Ken Lay,  the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.  spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his  ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next  week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.   Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on  my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff  Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our  proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation  based on the governor's comments:  Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that  we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing  communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to  go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what  the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more  work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He  talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail  level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the  benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he  would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power  (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented  solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix  the problem by '02 and provide some political cover. Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also  included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed  interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a  goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities  to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate  analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues  including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.   He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas  purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding  some state sponsored credit support for the utilities. His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously  under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".   Some of these ideas would require legislative action. State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of  generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that  they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This  was a frequently recurring theme. Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus  basis to consumers. Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in  California. State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more  widely deploy distributed generation. Expand in-state gas production. Take state lands gas royalties in kind. negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for  addtional gas supplies. Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant  maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at  any one time. Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state. Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear  more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be  able to help out here). Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made  some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy  some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation  thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control  approach with generators. Securitize uncollected power purchase costs. To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's  thoughts and get them to Kari) He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --  not just the 5 one year strips. He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday. He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the  deal. He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the  forward contracting issues. Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 12/29/2000 10:13 AM --------------------------- From: Steven J Kean@ENRON on 12/28/2000 09:19 PM ", "id": "enron_1768"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["keith.holst@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2001-01-02 01:36:00", "subject": "New Generation, Nov 30th", "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/02/2001  09:34 AM ---------------------------     \t \t \tFrom:  Tim Belden                           12/05/2000 06:42 AM \t  To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: New Generation, Nov 30th   ---------------------- Forwarded by Tim Belden/HOU/ECT on 12/05/2000 05:44 AM  ---------------------------  Kristian J Lande  12/01/2000 03:54 PM  To: Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jake Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Frank W  Vickers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Elliot Mainzer/PDX/ECT@ECT, Michael McDonald/SF/ECT@ECT,  David Parquet/SF/ECT@ECT, Laird Dyer/SF/ECT@ECT, Jim Buerkle/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jim  Gilbert/PDX/ECT@ECT, Terry W Donovan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff G  Slaughter/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Ed Clark/PDX/ECT@ECT, Saji  John/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert  Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Matt Motley/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mike Swerzbin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Todd  Perry/PDX/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey Oh/PDX/ECT@ECT  Subject: New Generation, Nov 30th", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/02/2001 09:34 AM --------------------------- From: Tim Belden 12/05/2000 06:42 AM To: Phillip ", "id": "enron_1769"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["gallen@thermon.com"], "sent_at": "2001-01-04 06:41:00", "subject": "(no subject)", "body": "Questions about 12/29 rentroll:   There were two deposits that were not labeled.

The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the  forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a  supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights.   \"Traders do that all the time; they're looking forward,\" said William Burson,  a trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\"   But the market's response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas  Association's director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the  storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the  numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than  reality.   \"It's a little frustrating that they don't take the time to understand what  we are reporting,\" McGill said.   As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons --  and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing  fingers at Wall Street.   Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently  stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market's speculators for  the rise in gas prices.   \"It's my firm belief ... that today's gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik  told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly.   In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric  utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry.   Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame  for this winter's startling gas bills, having failed to protect their  customers and constituents from such price spikes.   Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take  precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price  insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas  prices before they soared.   \"We're passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul  Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy.   But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers.   \"There's been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to  change,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security  Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass.    Hot topic   Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In  many circles, little else is discussed.   The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is  facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the  previous December's bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as  well.   The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of  his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial  pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating.   \"It's the talk of the town here,\" he said.   A year ago that wasn't a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per  thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn't make it worthwhile  to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by  customers.   But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand  cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage  for winter.   There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November,  prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information  Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating  bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher.   But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country,  including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas  markets.   \"It's all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis.   Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York  traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile  commodity in the world.    Setting the price   In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of  gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading  contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had  widespread influence over gas prices.   The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon  as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale  prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from  utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what  they pay for the gas they expect to use.   There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention  of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge  of natural gas.   But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don't need to  know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they're trading. Like all  futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to  their volatility and to the traders' ability to make or lose a lot of money  in a short time.   As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less  than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10.  Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association's  weekly storage numbers.   Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to  need in the winter.   Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than  average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in  hopes that the summer's unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop.   Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be  sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the  concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient.   Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage  numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the  association's McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage.   But some utility executives didn't share that view. William Eliason, vice  president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December's cold snap had  continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand.   \"I was getting worried,\" he said.   Then suddenly the market turned when January's weather turned warmer.  Wednesday's storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices  dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet.    Just passing through   Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but  pass their fuel costs on to customers.   Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers' cost-of-gas  charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas  Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday.   Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last  month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could  be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve  energy.   Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to  save an average customer about $25 this winter.   Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an  extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not  guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs.   Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left  customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether  they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel  costs.   On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public  Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to  perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy's gas purchasing practices.   \"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It's time to consider  some changes.\"    To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to  severly@kcstar.com.     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -- All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star", "preview": "By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star Date: 01/20/01 22:15 As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile Exchange kept one eye on ", "id": "enron_1786"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["john.lavorato@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2001-01-22 06:06:00", "subject": "Re: Response to PGE request for gas", "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 01/22/2001  02:06 PM --------------------------- From: Travis McCullough on 01/22/2001 01:48 PM CST To: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: Response to PGE request for gas  Draft response to PGE -- do you have any comments?

Negotiations with SCE on this proposal are essentially  complete.  PG&E is OK with the docs.  All QFs but Calpine have agreed with  the IEP proposal -- Under the proposal, PG&E would \"retain\" $106 million (of  what, I'm not sure -- I think they mean a refund to PG&E from QFs who  switched to PX pricing). The money would come from changing the basis for the  QF payments from the PX price to the SRAC price, starting back in December  (and maybe earlier).  PG&E will not commit to a payment schedule and will not commit to take the  Force Majeure notices off the table. QFs are asking IEP to attempt to get  some assurances of payment.   SCE has defaulted with its QFs; PG&E has not yet -- but big payments are due  on 2/2/01.  For gas-fired QFs -- Heat rate of 10.2 included in formula for PG&E's  purchases from such QFs. Two people are negotiating the these agreements  (Elcantar and Bloom), but they are going very slowly. Not clear this can be  resolved. Batten and Keeley are refereeing this.  No discussions on this  occurred today.  Status of legislation -- Keeley left town for the night, so not much will  happen on the QFs.Assembly and Senate realize they have to work together.

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be  recouped in the first year of operation.  At permanent financing $1.1 would  be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.    Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the  investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split.  However, as I mentioned  earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as  part of the construction contract.    Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look  like here are a few ideas:   1.  Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.  Builder doesn't benefit from  higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.   2.  +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase  1 complete in November)       +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule       -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule  This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but  could be as favorable as 55/45.

Cash Needs Highlights: SCE\u0001,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a complete  cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a  program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligations  and other measures.  Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE\u0001,s  available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51.8  million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash  conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date. II. Credit Relationships Highlights: SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to  extend or renew credit as it has become due. At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE. SCE\u0001,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to default.  Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due and  payable. SCE\u0001,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond  indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more  indebtedness if it were feasible to do so. Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE\u0001,s credit ratings on most of its  rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade  issues within the last three weeks. III. Energy Cost Scenarios Highlights This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess  various price scenarios upon SCE\u0001,s projected cash depletion dates. Under such  scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001. IV. Cost Containment Initiatives Highlights SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001. The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital  improvement component as follows (in millions): Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77 Capital Improvement Costs                383 Total                                             $ 460 The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to  be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming from  contract employees. Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the  most part being deferred to a future date. SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and  executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost  savings of approximately $92 million. V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA  Activity) Highlights: As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the  Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This  includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500  million and accelerated revenues of $175 million. As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE\u0001,s  Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion. Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at the  end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit  balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to  D.01-01-018. Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from  generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are  tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as  expressed in the TRA, are overstated. TURN Proposal As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TURN  to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition assets.  Our comments are summarized as follows: The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that it  would not directly generate nor use cash. The Proposal\u0001,s impact on SCE\u0001,s balance sheet would initially be to shift  costs between two regulatory assets. TURN\u0001,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the  revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection in  the TRA is overstated. VI. Flow of Funds Analysis Highlights: In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a  positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion. During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to  its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion. Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its  shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding common  stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrative  and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes. [there is no Section VII]   VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates SCE\u0001,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500  million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.  In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.  This increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period.

I have shifted  to a slightly different plan.  There were too many design items that I could  not work out in the plan we discussed previously.  Now, I am leaning more  towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center.  One  wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3  kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs.  The other wing would have a garage +  guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs.  This  plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the  courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor  living.  I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.   The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass  skylights supported by metal posts.  I am envisioning the two wings to have  single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building.    I don't know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe.

I had at least 5 people here past midnight on both nights and I have  several people who have not left before 10:30 this week.  2.)  It is my understanding that Susan was still booking new day deals on  Thursday night at 8:30 b/c she did not get deal tickets from the trading  floor until after 5:00 p.m. 3.)  It is also my understanding that Susan is done with the p&l and  benchmark part of her book often times by 6:00,  but that what keeps her here  late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets.  (One  suggestion might be a permanent IT person on this book.)  (This was also my  understanding from Kyle Etter,  who has left the company.)

If they can really build this  many plants it could have a huge impact on the Cal border basis.  Obviously  it is dependent on what capacity is added on Kern, PGT and TW but it is hard  to envision enough subscriptions to meet this demand.  Even if it is  subscribed it will take 18 months to 2 years to build new pipe therefore the  El Paso 1.2 Bcf/d could be even more valuable.

The structure they are looking for is a firm physical  sale at a NYMEX related price.  There is a very good chance that they will do  this all with one party.

Review risk books-  Is Enron accurately accounting for physical  imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?  4.

The principal change is in the addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than sufficient, but there will be additional updates.  The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

They do not want the school to come back at a later date for something different.  Doug Bell will meet with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the subject.  It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF wants something in writing to that effect.  I spoke to AMF's attorney today, and explained the situation.  They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.  AMF's broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after the March 29 hearing.  We may close this deal in April.  The Stage is still on go.  An assumption package has been sent to the buyer, and I have overnighted a copy of the contract and a description of the details to Wayne McCoy.

The principal change is in the addition of masonry on the front of the buildings, which I estimate will costs at least $84,000 additional.  Also, the trim material and labor costs have been increased.  I still believe that the total cost is more than sufficient, but there will be additional updates.  The manager's unit is columns J-L, but the total is not included in the B&N total of rentable units.  Rather, the total cost for the manager's unit and office is included as a lump sum under amenities.  I may add this back in as a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity.

First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from Keith?  I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in the transaction.  2.  Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC)  will be in the range of 75% - 80%.  The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal.  Given the above pro-forma performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit officer as an 80% LTC.  This, of course, is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal.  3.  The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers deferred profit.  Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as deferred profit has been acceptable.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about  500+ units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos,  this, we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested loan amount to $8,868,000.  I have summarized our issues as follows:  1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:       Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment      Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR      2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475      3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417  2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit turn over.  3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).  4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x  debt coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.  5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.  6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:       Land -                   $1,121,670      Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000      Cash Equity              $1,419,268      Total                    $2,955,938  7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage  of actual hard construction costs.

My version of a buyout is attached.  I need your expert advise.  I am ready to offer my version or threaten to  foreclose.  Do they have a case that they are due money for their time?

As shown on the attached summary table, cash expenditures total $21,196 and  existing contracts to the architect, civil engineer, soils testing company,  and appraisal total $67,050.? The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which  current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.  Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this  project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design  and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of  our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or  rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.?   Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a  percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on  your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%,  or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the  second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per  year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these  valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the  forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in  the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future  projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per  month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.?

We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we  offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout  offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are  prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.?  If this is your     choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney,  Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.?

According to BPA, it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had been telling California's Department of Water Resources that the sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.  Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back. Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending exchange energy into California, however.  More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 03/15/2001 02:22 PM --------------------------- \"Arthur O'Donnell\" <aod@newsdata.com> on 03/15/20", "id": "enron_1875"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["stagecoachmama@hotmail.com"], "sent_at": "2001-03-15 07:39:00", "subject": "(no subject)", "body": "Lucy,  Here is the rentroll.

What are  typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?   How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main  contacts at SW Gas?  We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our  control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably  have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the  commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their  commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....)  should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month  index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That  risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of  their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.  As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are  there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly  appreciated.  Thanks,  Laird", "preview": "Laird, Did you meet with SWG on April 27th.

Below is a  list of questions on the specs:  1.  Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine?  Wouldn't fir or spruce warp less  and cost about the same?  2.  What type of floor joist would be used?  2x12 or some sort of factory  joist?  3.  What type for roof framing?  On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?  4.  Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound?  What  type of insulation in floors and ceiling?  Batts or blown?  Fiberglass or  Cellulose?  5.  Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?  6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides?  I didn't know  the difference between an apron and a stool.  7.  Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent  cracking?  Double plywood or hardi board underlay?  8.  On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister?  I was thinking a partial  one out of iron.  Only about 5 feet.  9.  I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under  the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.  10.  Are undermount sinks different than drop ins?  I was thinking undermount  stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.  11.  1 or 2 A/C units?  I am assuming 2.  12.  Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?  13.  No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?  14.  Exterior porches included in bid?  Cedar decking on upstairs?  Iron  railings?  15.  What type of construction contract would you use?  Fixed price except  for change orders?  I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but  this is a start.  I think I am ready to get plans drawn up.  I am going to  call Cary Kipp to see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.  Phillip I", "preview": "Reagan, Thank you for the quick response on the bid for the residence.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new  building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being  offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.  This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the  new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The  cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is  currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly  employee cost of $94.00.  If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to  the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made  as spaces become available.   The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be  opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street  level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available.  Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an  exit in the event of elevator trouble.   If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to  Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your  email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and  receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new  garage.  The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and  Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.   (You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians,  will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 04/02/2001 02:49 PM --------------------------- Parking & Transportation@ENRON 03/28/2001 02:07 P", "id": "enron_1904"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["jacquestc@aol.com"], "sent_at": "2001-04-03 01:53:00", "subject": "(no subject)", "body": "Jacques,  The assets and liabilities that we are willing to assume are listed below:  Assets:  Land Preliminary Architecture Design-Kipp Flores Architects Preliminary Engineering-Cuatro Consultants, Ltd.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs.  March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand  over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for  temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates  into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as  compared with the previous year.  Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary  reductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other  forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making  total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.   This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple  more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6%  decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the  retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it  is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last  year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in  Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation  are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of  meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general  economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least  make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.  Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area  only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC  (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO  portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in  demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As  you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum  smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at  least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its  wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several  mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are  sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly  how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.   Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif's  economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of  the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I  think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already  realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the  non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the  WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around  6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.  I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you  with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I  hope this helps.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that  the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large  part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which  the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman  began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or  answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had  some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:  Price caps are almost never the right answer Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce  demand, is not acceptable Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would  export California's problems to the West  This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it's a pretty  strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner  out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and  if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the  agenda.  Hope this info helps.

Current Notes User:  REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)  1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook  client will be configured on your computer. After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail  via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is  configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is  migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your  web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.  PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and  To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook  client is configured on your desktop.  2. Remote access to your mailbox. After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA)  for remote access to your mailbox.  PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while  connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA  available from your home or when traveling abroad.  HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)  Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:   http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe  Substitute \"john.doe\" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You  will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in \"corp/your user  id\" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You  will now be able to view your mailbox.     PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between  the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things  in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the  functions NOT available via OWA:  Features NOT available using OWA:  -  Tasks -  Journal -  Spell Checker -  Offline Use -  Printing Templates -  Reminders -  Timed Delivery -  Expiration -  Outlook Rules -  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall -  Sharing Contacts with others -  Task Delegation -  Direct Resource Booking -  Personal Distribution Lists  QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack  of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the  bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans  and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is  reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and  Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the  bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into  the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and  the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of  the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.   Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term  power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the  bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of  contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge  loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very  difficult.  The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state  would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8  billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this  concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full  disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the  details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they  will support the bond issuance to go forward.  Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB  31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill  passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of  Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for  community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be  amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen,  currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should  get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be  likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).    According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature,  Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money  available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated  that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.   Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The  Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally,  Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and  there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.   Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B    Bear Stearns  $625 M Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77% Current Projected  Blended IR:  5.38% Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001 For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510  Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the  California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be  authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the  additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing  power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these  authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the  governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond  amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to  support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB  6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid   for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for   the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can   be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this  idea  earlier in the crisis.   SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The  first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the  governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is  August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According  to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has  signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis  and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates  that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary  bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.    The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond  issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan)  stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers,  then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the  state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and  passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.", "preview": "---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 05/07/2001 06:54 AM --------------------------- From: Kristin Walsh/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/04/200", "id": "enron_1941"}, {"from": "phillip.allen@enron.com", "recipients": ["matthew.lenhart@enron.com", "jay.reitmeyer@enron.com", "matt.smith@enron.com"], "sent_at": "2001-05-07 02:28:00", "subject": "Re: Western Wholesale Activities - Gas & Power Conf.

At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt- hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.      \"Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing prices to decline,\" said one Southwest trader.      According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.      At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank $202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.      Traders said that Arizona's Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.      At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power slumped 47.5 percent from Friday's Sunday-Monday package to a Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.      According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling demand 84 percent below normal.      \"We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is causing temperatures to drop,\" said one Northwest trader.      At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at $175.00-$228.00.      According the California Independent System Operator today's forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743 megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.  -Robert Scalabrino   Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand       Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in available generation coupled with less weather-related demand, caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.      According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri, temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.      In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from Friday.      \"There's just no weather out there,\" said one PJM-based trader. \"There's no need for air conditioning, and no need for heating. As far as I can tell, it's going to be that way all week long.\"      Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000 megawatts through Friday.      Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to hit the grid tomorrow.      Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 nuclear power facilities.      The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1 at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned and operated by Niagara Mohawk.      Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to $58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to $51.25 and $40.00 indices.      ~ -Karyn Rispoli   Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up       Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast, traders said.      \"It's supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy to there,\" one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said. \"Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of that.\"      The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25 when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.      Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00 and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.      Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at $28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee, forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.      \"Things should continue along these lines for the rest of the week, because there's enough power to get down there but not so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,\" an ECAR trader said.      In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up, though traders said transmission problems limited volume.      Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50, and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with trades from $32.00-$40.00.      Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.      For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.      Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted tomorrow's high temperature would be 85 degrees in Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.      \"There's no available transmission from ComEd, and problems getting power out of Ameren's grid too,\" one MAPP trader said. \"It's likely to cause problems all week, since it's hot here and down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).\"  -Ken Fahnestock   Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up       Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.      Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5 degrees higher than today's projected high. Cooler weather is expected to begin Wednesday.      Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity, temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week, propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.       The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20. Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.      On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.      In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.      \"There's just no overnight load to do anything with the supply we have,\" said one Texas-based utility power trader. \"Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree (Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we've seen is 85 degrees, so that's about 10 degrees below normal for us.\"      On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at $35-$36.      Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.      Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.      In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders said.      On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades were noted.  -Brian Whary   U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids       London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K. fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling interest, traders said.      Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than Friday.      The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting price levels, traders said.      Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.      June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.      On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15 pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since the start of last week.      Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements. Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels, they said.  -Amal Halawi   Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest       Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid limited hydro-supply, traders said.      Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00 megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour. Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50- 214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.      \"The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,'' an Oslo- based trader said. \"I'm surprised that even at the peak of the snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are steadily climbing.''      Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters. Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a \"more realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet outlooks.''      Tuesday's system area average price was set below expecations of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour, down 7.45 kroner from today's price. Still, traders said this was a \"high'' spot price for this time of the year.      Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour with 140 megawatts exchanged.      Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours generation, up 368 percent from Friday's 1,169 gigawatt-hours.  -Alejandro Barbajosa -0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT \u000f$    - daily.pdf", "preview": "Here is today's copy of Bloomberg Power Lines.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be  an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is  O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to  get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and  I'll take care of it..  On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate  curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of  $235,019.    (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your  overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects  something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal  #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.   139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)   139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)   139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)   231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)   153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)  Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to  GDP-Kingsgate.   Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five  different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for  withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a  Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is  that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport  losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.   I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a  systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems  that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times,  the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the  detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it  appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be  an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar  impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in  case there's something you want to do about it.  The columns below show the  volumes under each ticket and the p&L associated with each.

The  WSCC data, which is dicey and we don't have until July 1999, and the CEMMS,  which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes  the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but  there can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\"  generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn't schedule their  generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you  will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california  munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is,  if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply  schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said  all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on  the generation side.  On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While  they don't split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is  better than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the  load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.  I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with  others up here once you have it finished.  I'd like to see how much gas  demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity,  especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the  UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal  consumer then it is obviously a different story.

If you haven't taken the time to update your GIS  information, please do so.  It is essential that this function be performed  as soon as possible. Please read the following memo sent to you a few days  ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to  call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.  With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees  between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to  have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee  data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the  year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC  requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their  profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education  need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is  accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to  hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com  on the command line of your browser.  The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would  like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned  for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please  contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.    Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.      Thanks,   Dave", "preview": "What is GIS info?
